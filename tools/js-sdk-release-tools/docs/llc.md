# Azure JS RLC Tool
Azure JS RLC Tool can help you get llc codes by one command in few minutes.

*Note: Currently, this tools only supports generating dataplane sdk, and only can run in powershell/bash.*

## Install
```shell script
npm install -g @azure-tools/js-sdk-release-tools
```

## How to use

### Prerequisites
1. Install Any of the [LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
2. Install autorest: `npm install -g autorest`.
3. Install rush: `npm install -g @microsoft/rush`.
4. use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone [azure-sdk-for-js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js) or [azure-sdk-for-js-pr](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js-pr). Then go to the root of sdk repository and run `rush update`. For example:
```shell
cd azure-sdk-for-js
rush update
```
### Steps

##### Step 1. Run command:
```
rlc-code-gen --package-name=<your package name>
```
*Note*:
   - *Please replace with your package name, for example: `rlc-code-gen --package-name=@azure-rest/purview-account`. If you don't provide it, the tool will ask you to input it interactively.*
   - *You also can use command `rlc-code-gen --readme=<the path of swagger/README.md>` to generate codes if `swagger/README.md` exists. Then it will skip Step 2 and go to Step 3 directly.*
   - *If you run command with `--interactive`, then the tool asks to re-check some values in `swagger/README.md` if it exists.*
##### Step 2. Generate swagger/README.md
If your package is first release or doesn't contain `swagger/README.md`, the tool will ask you to input some necessary information. If not, please skip this step.
   
For example:

```
Which resource provider do you want to store your package in sdk folder? Please input it: purview
```

You need to provide following information. You can refer to [README.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/purview/purview-catalog-rest/swagger/README.md) as an example.

You also can provide the information when running command `rlc-code-gen`, such as `rlc-code-gen --package-name=<your package name> --title=<your title> --description=<your description>`.

##### Step 3. The tool will generate codes and build generated codes automatically. Finally, you can get RLC codes.

   - If you want to write test, please start from sample test from `test` folder.

Please refer to [template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/template/template) as a good start.

# Contribute
If you want to contribute to this tool, please start from [src/llcCodegenAutomation.ts](src/llcCodegenAutomationCLI.ts).
Also, you need to know what the tool does:

#### Generate Codes:
1. Generate `swagger/README.md`
2. Generate source code by codegen
3. Add/update ci.yml
4. Update rush.json
#### Build Codes:
1. Run `rush update`
2. Run `rush build -t <your package name>`
3. Generate changelog(Because released package doesn't include review folder, so we generate an initial release changelog if there is no existing CHANGELOG.md.)
4. Clean compiled codes
