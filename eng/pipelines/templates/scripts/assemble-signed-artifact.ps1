.SYNOPSIS
Assembles a signed file + artifact into an output artifact.


.DESCRIPTION
Takes the signed output folder and assembles it into an output artifact. For each platform, there is a slightly different methodology to re-assembling them due to how they were constructed.

For windows signing:
  - We need to move code sign summary files to their own folder, we don't want to place the code sign summary in the package itself
  - After moving the code sign files, package the signed file directory.
  - Send the whole directory to a zip folder

For mac signing:
  - We will have an unzipped artifact folder, but will be handed the individual signed zip.
  - We need to unzip that payload.zip
  - We need to chmod +x the unzipped executable
  - We need to override the executable in the original artifact folder
  - Send the resulting directory to a zip folder.

For linux signing:
  - Do nothing, pass through


.PARAMETER Rid
The targeted dotnet framework. Example values: osx-x64, win-x64, linux-arm64

.PARAMETER BinariesDirectory
The folder containing the downloaded file contents of "binaries" artifact.

.PARAMETER SignedFileDirectory
The folder containing the result of the signing operation.

For a sample run against rid osx-x64:

prepare-artifact-for-signing.ps1 runs -> unzips and readies for signing
signing stage runs, replaces dropped files in place
assemble-signed-artifact.ps1 runs -> moves files into the correct place if necessary, rezips

The file structure that this script will operate against will look like the following

<BinariesDir>
   test-proxy-standalone-osx-x64 <-- the expanded folder from the rid binary that we're currently working on
   <original test-proxy-standalone-osx-x64 file has been deleted by the same step that expanded it. when we recompress it'll nicely fit in place>
   test-proxy-standalone-osx-x64-Signing <-- only if necessary, like for mac (and maybe linux)
   test-proxy-standalone-linux-arm64.tar.gz <-- the other binaries that will be operated upon by other steps according to what rid is running
   test-proxy-standalone-linux-x64.tar.gz
   test-proxy-standalone-osx-arm64.tar.gz
   test-proxy-standalone-win-x64.zip
