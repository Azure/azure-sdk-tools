The code snippet is written in Python.

It defines a class called `BanoodleClient`. Within this class:

- There is an instance variable `name`, which is likely intended to hold the name associated with the `BanoodleClient` instance.
- The method `new_banoodle` is defined to create a new `BanoodleClient` instance, taking a required string parameter `name` and accepting additional keyword arguments through `**options`.
- The method `erase_banoodle` is defined to presumably remove or delete a `Banoodle` identified by the `name` parameter, also accepting additional options.

The coder appears to be implementing functionality for managing "banoodles," allowing for the creation and removal of these entities within the `BanoodleClient` context.
