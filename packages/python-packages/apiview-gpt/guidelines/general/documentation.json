For example, a Cosmos DB code snippet should not include both account and container creation operations--create two different snippets, one for account creation, and one for container creation.\n\nCombined operations cause unnecessary friction for a library consumer by requiring knowledge of additional operations which might be outside their current focus. It requires them to first understand the tangential code surrounding the operation they're working on, then carefully extract just the code they need for their task. The developer can no longer simply copy and paste the code snippet into their project.\n\n[Architecture Board]: https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk/issues\n\n[General Azure SDK Guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/general/introduction.md %}\n[Azure SDK Contributors Guide]: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute-ref/contribute-ref-how-to-document-sdk\n[Microsoft Writing Style Guide]: https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2700\n[Microsoft Cloud Style Guide]: https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2696\n[Acrolinx VS Code extension]: https://aka.ms/azsdk/acrolinx-vscode\n[rest-lro]: https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#13-long-running-operations\n\n[general-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/general/introduction.md %}\n[android-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/android/design.md %}\n[clang-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/clang/design.md %}\n[cpp-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/cpp/introduction.md %}\n[dotnet-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/dotnet/introduction.md %}\n[golang-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/golang/introduction.md %}\n[ios-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ios/introduction.md %}\n[java-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/java/introduction.md %}\n[python-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/python/design.md %}\n[typescript-guidelines]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/typescript/introduction.md %}\n\n[android-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/android.md %}\n[dotnet-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/dotnet.md %}\n[go-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/go.md %}\n[ios-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/ios.md %}\n[java-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/java.md %}\n[js-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/js.md %}\n[python-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/python.md %}\n[cpp-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/cpp.md %}\n[c-latest-releases]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/latest/c.md %}\n\n[README-EXAMPLE]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/docs/policies/README-EXAMPLE.md\n[README-TEMPLATE]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/docs/policies/README-TEMPLATE.md\n"
