            "comment": "Here is a summary of the service described by this APIView:\n\nOverview  \nThis API provides image analysis capabilities that enable the extraction and interpretation of various visual features from images provided as byte streams or via URLs. The service supports a range of analysis types including caption generation, dense captioning, object and person detection, optical character recognition, smart cropping, and tagging. It is designed with distributed tracing support and leverages context management for resource handling.\n\nAPI Version  \nThe API clients accept an `api_version` parameter during initialization. Although no dedicated API version object is defined in this view, the version is configurable through the client.\n\nPrimary Client Classes  \nThe API exposes a synchronous client class, `ImageAnalysisClient`, and an asynchronous client class, `AsyncImageAnalysisClient`. The `ImageAnalysisClient` offers the following methods: `__init__`, `analyze`, `analyze_from_url`, `close`, and `send_request`. The `AsyncImageAnalysisClient` provides analogous methods: `__init__`, `analyze`, `analyze_from_url`, `close`, and a static `send_request`.\n\nOther Classes and Models  \nSupporting models are organized under the `models` namespace and represent the structure of analysis results and image components. These include classes such as `CaptionResult`, `CropRegion`, `DenseCaption`, `DenseCaptionsResult`, `DetectedObject`, `detectedPerson`, `DetectedTag`, `DetectedTextBlock`, `DetectedTextLine`, `DetectedTextWord`, `ImageAnalysisResult`, `ImageBoundingBox`, `ImageMetadata`, `ImagePoint`, `ObjectsResult`, `PeopleResult`, `ReadResult`, `SmartCropsResult`, and `TagsResult`. Additionally, the `VisualFeatures` enumeration lists available visual feature types including `CAPTION`, `DENSE_CAPTIONS`, `OBJECTS`, `PEOPLE`, `READ`, `SMART_CROPS`, and `tags`.\n\nAdditional Details  \nThe clients implement context management protocols (with `ImageAnalysisClient` as a `ContextManager` and `AsyncImageAnalysisClient` as an `AsyncContextManager`) to manage resource lifecycles. Decorators for distributed tracing (`@distributed_trace` and `@distributed_trace_async`) are used to support observability within distributed environments. The model classes inherit from `MutableMapping`, offering flexible access to their properties, and support multiple construction patterns either via explicit parameters or mappings.",
