            "answer": "You're encountering an SSL certificate error when running live tests for async APIs, specifically when connecting to https://localhost:5001. This is the test proxy endpoint, and the error is likely due to certificate verification failing. Although the same code works for another team member, the issue may be caused by environment variables \u2014 either missing or incorrectly set.\nTo run live tests, make sure AZURE_TEST_RUN_LIVE is set to \"true\". If you also want to record, avoid setting AZURE_SKIP_LIVE_RECORDING. As a workaround for the SSL issue, set the environment variable PROXY_URL to http://localhost:5000 instead of using HTTPS. This bypasses certificate validation and resolves the issue.",

            "answer": "The SSL certificate verification error you encountered when running live tests for async APIs in the Callautomation Python SDK is a known issue when using the test proxy with HTTPS (`PROXY_URL='https://localhost:5001'`). This error occurs because the test proxy uses a self-signed certificate, which may not be correctly configured or trusted in your environment, especially for async tests.\n\nTo resolve this issue and successfully run your live tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Update your branch to the latest main**: Ensure your local branch includes the latest changes from the main branch of the Azure SDK for Python repo. The test proxy's certificate is occasionally rotated, and having the latest version helps avoid certificate mismatches.\n\n2. **If the error persists (especially in async environments)**: This is likely due to an async-specific environment issue with SSL verification. The recommended workaround is to unset the `PROXY_URL` environment variable, which will default the test proxy to use HTTP (`http://localhost:5000`) instead of HTTPS. HTTP mode does not require certificate verification and avoids this error.\n\n   - To do this, remove or unset the `PROXY_URL` variable from your environment or `.env` file.\n\n3. **If you require HTTPS for your tests**: If your tests must use HTTPS, and the above steps do not resolve the issue, you should reach out to the Azure SDK team for further assistance, as async environments can still fail nondeterministically with SSL even after updating certificates.\n\n**Summary of recommended action:**\n- Unset `PROXY_URL` to default to HTTP for your test proxy endpoint.\n- If you must use HTTPS, ensure your branch is up to date and contact the Azure SDK team if the issue persists.\n\nThis approach is documented in the official Azure SDK for Python test proxy troubleshooting guide.",

            "answer": "Your Python SDK generation is failing due to unresolved relative imports in your TypeSpec files (errors like 'Couldn't resolve import \"../Discovery.Shared/namespace.tsp\"'). This typically happens when the TypeSpec compiler cannot locate the referenced files because they are outside the main service directory.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to specify the additional directories containing the shared TypeSpec files in your configuration. For Azure SDK pipelines and local generation, this is done by adding an `additionalDirectories` array to your TypeSpec location configuration (often in a file like `tsp-location.yaml`).\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n1. Locate or create the `tsp-location.yaml` file in your service's TypeSpec directory.\n2. Add the `additionalDirectories` property, listing the relative paths to all folders containing the shared TypeSpec files you import. For example:\n\n```yaml\ndirectory: specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Workspace\nrepo: Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr\ncommit: <your-commit-sha>\nadditionalDirectories:\n  - specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Shared\n```\n\n3. Make sure the paths are relative to the repo root and point to the folders containing the referenced `.tsp` files.\n4. Commit this change and re-run the pipeline or local generation.\n\nThis will ensure the TypeSpec compiler can resolve all relative imports and your Python SDK generation should succeed.\n\nIf you are using a different config file or tool, look for an equivalent `additionalDirectories` or import path setting.",

Configuration\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n# handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Configuration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration can be provided via the `tspconfig.yaml` configuration file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec compiler will look for the closest `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the same directory or closest parent directory from the TypeSpec entrypoint.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example if running `tsp compile /dev/foo/bar/main.tsp`, the compiler will lookup the file at the folllowing paths (in order):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/bar/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Schema\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe file is a `yaml` document with the following structure. See the [next section](#typespec-configuration-options) for details on each option.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel TypeSpecProjectSchema {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameters?: Record\\\\\\\\u003c{default: string}\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `environment-variables`?: Record\\\\\\\\u003c{default: string}\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `warn-as-error`?: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `output-dir`?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `trace`?: string | string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  imports?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emit?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `dry-run`?: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  options?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  linter?: LinterConfig;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel LinterConfig {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends?: RuleRef[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  enable?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cRuleRef, boolean\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  disable?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cRuleRef, string\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Extending Project Files\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere may be instances where you want to build different folders with varying options (such as different emitters), but still want to share some common configurations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, you can use the `extends` property in the configuration file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, in `\\\\\\\\u003cmy-pkg\\\\\\\\u003e/tspconfig.yaml`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    some-option: my-name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    some-other-option: This is a title\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin `\\\\\\\\u003cmy-pkg\\\\\\\\u003e/proj2/tspconfig.yaml`, enable `emitter1` using the options specified in the parent `tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=proj2/tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What gets extended\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe extending logic follows these rules:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Root-level properties**: Shallow merge for all properties except `options`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Options property**: Deep merge at one level (per emitter)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Override behavior**: Properties specified in the extending file will completely override those from the extended file\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Root-level merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen extending a configuration, most properties (like `emit`, `imports`, `trace`, etc.) are merged at the root level. If the same property exists in both files, the extending file's value completely replaces the extended file's value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Options merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `options` property receives special treatment with a one-level deep merge:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Different emitters from both files are combined\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- If the same emitter is configured in both files, the extending file's emitter configuration completely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ncompletely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:   # Completely replaces emitter1 options\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-c: value-c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter3:   # Added alongside emitter2 from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-y: value-y\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Resulting merged config:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// emit: [emitter3]  # Only emitter3, emitter1 is gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// options:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter1: { option-c: value-c }  # Only option-c, option-a and option-b are gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter2: { option-x: value-x }  # Inherited from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter3: { option-y: value-y }  # From extending config\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Variable interpolation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec project file provides variable interpolation using:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- config file parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- emitter options can reference each other\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nVariable interpolation is done using an variable expression surrounded by `{` and `}`. (`{\\\\\\\\u003cexpression\\\\\\\\u003e}`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExamples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `{output-dir}/my-path`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `{env.SHARED_PATH}/my-path`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Interpolation of Emitter Path Config\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nemitter                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `service-name`             | service name             | Name of the service                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `service-name-if-multiple` | service name if multiple | Name of the service if multiple, undefined if one                                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Project Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can define certain parameters that can subsequently be specified through the CLI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nParameters can be organized in a nested structure, to access different levels of the structure, use dots (`.`) in the variable expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTherefore, parameter names should not contain `.` in their name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be utilized in the default value of these parameters.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese parameters can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll parameters must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  base-dir:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {base-dir}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe parameter can then be specified via `--arg` in this format `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` and for nested structures `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e.\\\\\\\\u003cnested-parameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntsp compile . --arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"base-dir=/path/to/base\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can specify which environment variables it can interpolate.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be used in the default value of these environment variables.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese environment variables can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression, using the `env.` prefix.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll environment variables must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenvironment-variables:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  BASE_DIR:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {env.BASE_DIR}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Emitter Options\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCertain emitter configurations can be interpolated using a specific rule designed to collapse a path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a variable is succeeded by a `/` or `.` and the emitter responsible for interpolating the config doesn't supply that variable, the path segment will be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, consider the following config value: `{service-name}/output.{version}.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's what would be produced:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Service name value | Version value | Result                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`        | `PetStore/output.v1.json` |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `undefined`   | `PetStore/output.json`    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Variable name              | Scope                    | Description

For these scenarios, you can use the [`namespace` configuration option](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/emitter/#namespace) in your `tspconfig.yaml` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you want the published SDK to follow closely with the package structure and namespaces in your TypeSpec file, you should also pass in the `package-name` flag with the desired value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Using the `namespace` Flag\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `namespace` option allows you to specify where the generated code should be placed within your package structure. This is particularly useful for cases where you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Keep generated code isolated in a dedicated subdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing SDK structures\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Separate generated code from hand-written code\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Example Configuration\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we will take you through emitting generated code into a specific subdirectory (like `_generated`), with the idea that you will be fully-wrapping the generated code.

Make sure there are configuration for Python SDK like:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"service-dir\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR-SERVICE-DIRECTORY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit: [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // this value does not affect python code generation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    emitter-output-dir: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{output-dir}/{service-dir}/YOUR-PACKAGE-DIR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    namespace: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR.NAMESPACE.NAME\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    flavor: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`YOUR.NAMESPACE.NAME` is your namespace name; `YOUR-PACKAGE-DIR` is your package directory; `YOUR-SERVICE-DIRECTORY` is SDK directory name. For example, assume that namespace is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure.ai.anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and you want to put it in folder \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-for-python/sdk/anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR.NAMESPACE.NAME\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure.ai.anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR_PACKAGE_DIR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure-ai-anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR-SERVICE-DIRECTORY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sdk/anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"dev#mgmt#sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure Python SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide for TypeSpec Migration\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/mgmt/sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Azure Python SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide for TypeSpec Migration\\\\\\\\n# dev#mgmt#sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Azure Python SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide for TypeSpec Migration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Azure Python SDK generally prohibits breaking changes unless they result from service behavior modifications. This guide helps you identify, review, and resolve breaking changes that may occur in new SDK versions due to migration of service specifications from Swagger to TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBreaking changes can be resolved by:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Client Customizations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nClient customizations should be implemented in a file named `client.tsp` located in the service's specification directory alongside the main entry point `main.tsp`. This `client.tsp` becomes the new specification entry point, so import `main.tsp` in the `client.tsp` file. **Do not** import `client.tsp` in the `main.tsp` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Add your customizations here\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. TypeSpec Configuration Changes\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration changes should be made in the `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the service's specification directory. This file is used to configure the TypeSpec compiler and client generator options. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Naming Changes with Numbers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPaired removal and addition entries showing naming changes from words to numbers:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` deleted or renamed its member `ZERO`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` deleted or renamed its member `THIRTY`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` added member `ENUM_0`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` added member `ENUM_30`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Swagger automatically converts numeric names to words during code generation, while TypeSpec preserves the original naming. This affects all type names, including enums, models, and operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the type definition by examining the names from the addition entries in the changelog (pattern: `Enum '\\\\\\\\u003ctype name\\\\\\\\u003e' added member xxx`):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nunion Minute {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  int32,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `0`: 0,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `30`: 30,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client customization to restore the original names from the removal entries:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Minute.`0`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ZERO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Minute.`30`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"THIRTY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Operation Naming Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval of an operation and addition of a similarly named operation for the same operation group:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Added operation StorageTaskAssignmentOperations.storage_task_assignment_list\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Removed operation StorageTaskAssignmentOperations.list\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: TypeSpec may generate different operation names than Swagger to avoid naming collisions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLocate the interface and operation using the name from the addition entries.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface StorageTaskAssignment {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op storageTaskAssignmentList(xxx): xxx;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client naming to restore the original operation name from the removal entries:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(StorageTaskAssignment.storageTaskAssignmentList, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"list\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Naming Changes from Directive\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPaired removal and addition entries showing naming changes for structs:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Added model `RedisResource`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `ResourceInfo`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, in the legacy config for swagger under the spec folder: `specification/\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e/resource-manager/readme.python.md`, the renaming directives could be found:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ndirective:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- rename-model:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  from: 'RedisResource'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  to: 'ResourceInfo'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Swagger has directive ways to change the naming.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the type definition by examining the names from the addition entries in the changelog (pattern: `Added model '\\\\\\\\u003ctype name\\\\\\\\u003e'`):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel RedisResource {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client customization to do the same renaming as the directives in the legacy config:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(RedisResource, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ResourceInfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 4. Client Naming Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval entry showing naming change of the client:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed client `IotDpsClient`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: TypeSpec generates client names based on the `namespace` name rather than the title annotation in the `@service` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the name from namespace:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"iotDpsClient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Microsoft.Devices;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUpdate it to the correct client name using `@@clientName`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Microsoft.Devices, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"IotDpsClient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 5. Reorder of Parameters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEntry showing the parameters get re-ordered for an operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Method `IotDpsResourceOperations.get` re-ordered its parameters from `['self', 'provisioning_service_name', 'resource_group_name', 'kwargs']` to `['self', 'resource_group_name', 'provisioning_service_name', 'kwargs']`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: TypeSpec generally uses generic to generate operations. An unified parameters' order will be widely shared in one operation group, and may make difference comparing to what defined in swagger.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOperation extends parameters from type `ProvisioningServiceDescription`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface ProvisioningServiceDescriptions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead\\\\\\\\u003cProvisioningServiceDescription, Error = ErrorDetails\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOverride the operation by a customized one with a manually designed order of parameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop IotDpsResourceGetCustomized(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provider: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.ThisWillBeReplaced\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningServiceName: string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.ResourceGroupNameParameter,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n): ProvisioningServiceDescription;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@override(ProvisioningServiceDescriptions.get,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  IotDpsResourceGetCustomized,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 6. Common Types Upgrade\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMultiple changes related to common infrastructure types such as `SystemData` and `IdentityType`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `IdentityType`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Common types are upgraded to their latest versions during TypeSpec migration.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Low impact since these are common infrastructure types rarely used directly by users.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 7. Removal of Unreferenced Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMultiple removals of unreferenced models that are typically not used in the SDK:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `ProxyResourceWithoutSystemData`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `Resource`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Unreferenced models are removed during TypeSpec migration.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Low impact since these models are typically not used directly by users.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 8. Removal of Pageable Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMultiple removals of models following the pattern `xxxList`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `ElasticSanList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `SkuInformationList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `SnapshotList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `VolumeGroupList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `VolumeList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Python will not expose pageable models for list APIs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Low impact since these models are typically not used directly by users.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 9. Parameters Changed to Keyword-only\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEntries showing the usage of passing parameters positionally is disabled:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Method `DpsCertificateOperations.delete` changed its parameter `certificate_name1` from `positional_or_keyword` to `keyword_only`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Query and header parameters in operation methods have been changed from positional to keyword-only by the new operation design.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Users should convert all positional parameters to keyword arguments\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 10. Removal of Parameter `if_match`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval of parameter `if_match` and addition of `etag/match_condition` for the same operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `DpsCertificateOperations` added parameter `etag` in method `create_or_update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `DpsCertificateOperations` added parameter `match_condition` in method `create_or_update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Method `DpsCertificateOperations.create_or_update` deleted or renamed its parameter `if_match` of kind `positional_or_keyword`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Header signatures `if_match/if_none_match` is replaced by `etag/match_condition` by the new operation design.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Replace `if_match=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cspecific etag\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` with `etag=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cspecific etag\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", match_condition=MatchConditions.IfNotModified`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 11. Removal of multi-level flattened properties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval of multiple parameters and addition of parameters `properties` entries for the same model:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` added property `properties`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `integrity_key`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `encryption_key`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `encryption_key_thumbprint`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `algorithm`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Typespec no longer supports multi-level flattening and will always preserve the actual REST API hierarchy.

            "answer": "Yes, to ensure the documentation for azure-ai-transcription appears under the \"cognitive-services\" category on Microsoft Learn, you need to add or update the metadata for this package in the metadata CSV file located at https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/_data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv.\nSpecifically, you should:\n1. Find (or add) the row for azure-ai-transcription in python-packages.csv.\n2. Set the MSDocService field to \"cognitive-services\". This value is used to correctly categorize the package in the Learn docs hierarchy.\n3. Ensure other relevant fields (ServiceName, DisplayName, Type, etc.) are filled in appropriately.\nAfter updating the CSV, commit and create a PR in the azure-sdk repo. Once merged, the next docs build will pick up the new metadata and your package will be categorized correctly.\nIf the Notes field for your package is set to \"Needs Review\", update it to another value to avoid automation overwriting your changes.\nReferences and field details can be found here:\n- [CSV field README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\n- [Relevant CSV file for Python packages](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/_data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv)\nIn summary: Yes, registering your package in the metadata CSV with MSDocService: cognitive-services is required. This action will resolve the warning and correct the Learn categorization.\n**References**\n[Publish SDK reference docs / Onboard a released package | Azure-sdk-docs-eng](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/develop/sdk-docs)\n[Metadata CSV update process for Python | Azure Sdk For Python Docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/deprecation_process.md)",

Specifically, in the metadata CSV (located at _data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv), set the MSDocService field to 'cognitive-services' for your package. This field is used to ensure the correct metadata for the docs site and controls the categorization in the documentation table of contents. If MSDocService is missing or incorrect, your package will appear under 'unknown'.\n\nAfter updating the CSV, run the documentation automation again to propagate the changes. If the Notes field for your package says 'Needs Review', update it to something else to prevent automation from overwriting your changes. Once the metadata is correct and the automation job completes, your documentation should appear under the correct category.\n\nIn summary: Yes, you need to update the metadata CSV for your package and set MSDocService: cognitive-services.",

This guide expands on how Azure Services should define Preview versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Preview Versioning Rules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Always make the last enum the preview and apply `@previewVersion` to it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Apply `@added(Versions.PreviewVersion)` to all preview items - these items will not show up in any GA Version\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For a new GA, add a new version enum **BEFORE** the preview enum value. Manually change all **preview** items that are GA'ing so that the `@added` version value matches the new GA enum value\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For any items remaining in **preview**, rename the **old

You'll need to\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\\\\\\\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*before* releasing.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays.

The `service_name` should match across all the SDK language repos\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nand should be name of the directory in the specification folder of the azure-rest-api-specs repo that contains the REST API definition file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn example is Service Bus, whose API definitions are in the `specifications/servicebus` folder of the azure-rest-api-specs repo,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nand uses the `service_name` \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"servicebus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNot every service follows this convention, but it should be the standard unless there are strong reasons to deviate.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn Python, a project's `package name` is the name used to publish the package in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor data plane libraries (management plane uses a different convention), the `package_name` could be just `azure-{service_name}`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn example is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure-servicebus\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSome services may need several different packages. For these cases a third component, the `module_name`, is added to the `package_name`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nas `azure-{service_name}-{module_name}`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `module_name` usually comes from the name of the REST API file itself or one of the directories toward the end of the file path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn example is the Synapse service, with packages `azure-synapse`, `azure-synapse-accesscontrol`, `azure-synapse-artifacts`, etc.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"deprecation_process.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Step 6: Update API Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/deprecation_process.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Step 6: Update API Documentation\\\\\\\\n## Update MS Learn docs\\\\\\\\n# deprecation_process.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Step 6: Update API Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Update MS Learn docs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Create your own fork of the [azure-sdk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk) repo and clone it, if you haven't already.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Create a branch in your local copy of the repo: `\\\\\\\\u003e git checkout -b python/azure-mypackage_deprecation`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Open the `_data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - If using Visual Studio Code, the `Edit CSV` extension may be helpful for editing the file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Find the entry for your package and update the following fields.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - `EOLDate`: In MM/DD/YYYY format.

If you need to include `microsoft` in the namespace (e.g. because of policy requirements for extensions to other projects such as `opentelemetry`), you should concatenate it with the package specific namespace with an underscore (e.g. `microsoft_myservice`). You may still use `microsoft-myservice` as the distribution package name in this scenario.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python-namespaces-naming\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" %} pick a package name that allows the consumer to tie the namespace to the service being used. As a default, use the compressed service name at the end of the namespace. The namespace does NOT change when the branding of the product changes. Avoid the use of marketing names that may change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA compressed service name is the service name without spaces. It may further be shortened if the shortened version is well known in the community. For example, \\\\u201cAzure Media Analytics\\\\u201d would have a compressed service name of `mediaanalytics`, and \\\\u201cAzure Service Bus\\\\u201d would become `servicebus`.

            "answer": "The \"black\" job in the Azure SDK for Python pipeline can fail for reasons beyond just code formatting. Even if running \"black\" locally with the same version (24.4.0) does not produce changes, there are a few areas to check for a root cause:\n1. Run Black with the Same Arguments as the Pipeline:The pipeline runs \"black\" using tox with specific arguments. Make sure you are running locally in the same way. From the official guidance, run: `tox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .` This ensures that the same config files, paths, and excludes are used. The pipeline may use a different configuration or target files that you are not formatting locally. Or you can tried the same command used by ci: `python -m azpysdk.main black --isolate sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects`.\n2. Check for Hidden Files or Config Differences: The pipeline uses the repository\u2019s configuration, including pyproject.toml and any exclude/include patterns. Local runs may inadvertently skip files due to local ignore files, environment differences, or working directory mismatches. Double-check that your local environment matches the CI context.\n3. Run `git status` or `git diff` to find out whether there are files already formatted but not pushed to the pr.\n4. Line Endings and Whitespace: Sometimes, black fails due to line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) or invisible whitespace issues that are not flagged locally. Make sure your files have consistent line endings (prefer LF in repo).\n5. Check the Pipeline Log for Specific Files: Review the pipeline's failure log closely to see which files are reported as needing formatting. Sometimes, it\u2019s a file outside your typical working set (such as generated code or test files).\n6. Reproduce in a Clean Environment: To eliminate local state issues, clone your repo in a fresh directory and re-run the pipeline\u2019s black command as above. If you confirm that running \"black\" via tox in a clean environment with the same version does not report changes, but the pipeline still fails, check for possible pipeline caching or artifact issues. Otherwise, use the pipeline log to identify exactly which file is causing the failure and focus on that file. Removing the check is not recommended; instead, focus on aligning your local runs with the pipeline invocation. If you continue to see unexplained failures, reach out in the Azure SDK language team channel with your findings and the specific pipeline log excerpt.",

            "answer": "The most common cause for the 'black' job failing in the Azure pipeline, even when running the same version locally does not produce changes, is a mismatch in the environment or invocation parameters between your local setup and the pipeline. Here are the recommended steps to resolve this:\n\n1. Ensure you are running 'black' with the exact same arguments as the pipeline. The pipeline may use specific configuration options or target files differently. You can reproduce the pipeline invocation locally by running:\n\ntox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .\n\nYou can also pass additional arguments after the '--' to target specific files or directories, just as the pipeline does.\n\n2. Make sure your local environment is clean and matches the pipeline. Sometimes, local caches or untracked files can affect results. Run 'git clean -xdf' before running 'black' locally to ensure a clean state.\n\n3. Double-check your 'pyproject.toml' for any configuration differences. The pipeline uses the settings in this file to determine how 'black' is run.\n\n4. If you continue to see discrepancies, check the pipeline logs for the exact command and file list being formatted. Compare this to your local run to ensure you are formatting the same files.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to reproduce and resolve the 'black' formatting issues locally, ensuring your PR passes the pipeline check. Do not remove the check from the pipeline, as it helps maintain code consistency across contributors.",

        "expected": {
            "answer": "The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\nHere are practical steps:\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\n```\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\nsphinx = false\n```",

            "answer": "To resolve the Python doc generation errors (unexpected indentation, block quote issues, duplicate explicit target names, and bullet list formatting) when emitting from TypeSpec to Python using tsp-client, you need to update your TypeSpec documentation comments and model definitions to be compatible with Sphinx and Python docstring formatting rules.\n\n**Key actions:**\n\n1. **Bulleted Lists and Block Quotes:**\n   - In TypeSpec, documentation comments support CommonMark markdown, but Sphinx (used for Python docs) is sensitive to indentation and blank lines, especially for lists and block quotes.\n   - Ensure that any bulleted lists in your `@doc` or block comments have a blank line before and after the list, and that list items are properly indented. For example:\n     ```typespec\n     /**\n      * This is a summary.\n      *\n      * - Item one\n      * - Item two\n      *\n      * More text after the list.\n      */\n     ```\n   - Avoid mixing block quotes and lists without blank lines between them.\n\n2. **Duplicate Explicit Target Names:**\n   - This error is usually caused by repeated markdown links with the same text (e.g., `[learn more](...)`) in the same docstring. Ensure that each link text is unique or only appears once per docstring.\n   - If you need multiple links, use different link texts or combine them into a single sentence.\n\n3. **Unexpected Indentation and Unindent Errors:**\n   - These are typically caused by inconsistent indentation in doc comments or by starting/ending lists or block quotes without blank lines.\n   - Always start block comments and lists with a blank line, and end them with a blank line.\n   - Avoid mixing markdown constructs (lists, quotes, code blocks) without clear separation.\n\n4. **ServiceTier Union Formatting:**\n   - For unions like `ServiceTier`, if you have a doc comment with a bullet list, ensure it is formatted as described above. For example:\n     ```typespec\n     /**\n      * Service tier options:\n      *\n      * - auto\n      * - default\n      * - flex\n      * - scale\n      * - priority\n      */\n     union ServiceTier {\n       \"auto\",\n       \"default\",\n       \"flex\",\n       \"scale\",\n       \"priority\",\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Response Model Documentation:**\n   - For the `Response` model, review all doc comments for properties and the model itself. Ensure that any lists, code blocks, or block quotes are separated by blank lines and properly indented.\n   - If you have nested documentation, keep indentation consistent and avoid starting a new markdown construct immediately after another without a blank line.\n\n6. **General TypeSpec Docstring Best Practices:**\n   - Use the TypeSpec formatter to ensure consistent indentation and layout ([see style guide](https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide)).\n   - Use block comments (`/** ... */`) for multi-line documentation and ensure markdown constructs are separated by blank lines.\n   - Avoid duplicate link texts and ensure all markdown is valid CommonMark.\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Update your TypeSpec files to follow these documentation formatting rules.\n- Re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python docs (`tox run -e sphinx ...`).\n- If errors persist, check the generated Python docstrings for problematic markdown and adjust your TypeSpec comments accordingly.\n\nThis approach will resolve the Sphinx docstring errors and ensure your Python SDK documentation builds cleanly.",

For example:\\\\n     ```typespec\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * This is a summary.\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - Item one\\\\n      * - Item two\\\\n      *\\\\n      * More text after the list.\\\\n      */\\\\n     ```\\\\n   - Avoid mixing block quotes and lists without blank lines between them.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Duplicate Explicit Target Names:**\\\\n   - This error is usually caused by repeated markdown links with the same text (e.g., `[learn more](...)`) in the same docstring. Ensure that each link text is unique or only appears once per docstring.\\\\n   - If you need multiple links, use different link texts or combine them into a single sentence.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Unexpected Indentation and Unindent Errors:**\\\\n   - These are typically caused by inconsistent indentation in doc comments or by starting/ending lists or block quotes without blank lines.\\\\n   - Always start block comments and lists with a blank line, and end them with a blank line.\\\\n   - Avoid mixing markdown constructs (lists, quotes, code blocks) without clear separation.\\\\n\\\\n4. **ServiceTier Union Formatting:**\\\\n   - For unions like `ServiceTier`, if you have a doc comment with a bullet list, ensure it is formatted as described above. For example:\\\\n     ```typespec\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * Service tier options:\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - auto\\\\n      * - default\\\\n      * - flex\\\\n      * - scale\\\\n      * - priority\\\\n      */\\\\n     union ServiceTier {\\\\n       \\\\\\\"auto\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"flex\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"scale\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"priority\\\\\\\",\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n\\\\n5. **Response Model Documentation:**\\\\n   - For the `Response` model, review all doc comments for properties and the model itself. Ensure that any lists, code blocks, or block quotes are separated by blank lines and properly indented.\\\\n   - If you have nested documentation, keep indentation consistent and avoid starting a new markdown construct immediately after another without a blank line.\\\\n\\\\n6. **General TypeSpec Docstring Best Practices:**\\\\n   - Use the TypeSpec formatter to ensure consistent indentation and layout ([see style guide](https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide)).\\\\n   - Use block comments (`/** ... */`) for multi-line documentation and ensure markdown constructs are separated by blank lines.\\\\n   - Avoid duplicate link texts and ensure all markdown is valid CommonMark.\\\\n\\\\n**Next steps:**\\\\n- Update your TypeSpec files to follow these documentation formatting rules.\\\\n- Re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python docs (`tox run -e sphinx ...`).\\\\n- If errors persist, check the generated Python docstrings for problematic markdown and adjust your TypeSpec comments accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach will resolve the Sphinx docstring errors and ensure your Python SDK documentation builds cleanly.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\\\\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\\\\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\\\\nHere are practical steps:\\\\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\\\\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\\\\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\\\\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\\\\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\\\\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\\\\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nsphinx = false\\\\n```\\\"}\"}]",

The guidance I got from API board a month ago is that main.tsp should only list the latest preview. API version  But doing so triggered this error. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nShould this be an error?  Or can we make this into a warning instead?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should only track the latest preview version in your TypeSpec files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf there are older preview Swagger files still in the repo, they can remain there for the required 90-day deprecation window, even if they're no longer listed in your .tsp files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhile TypeSpec validation currently throws an error if Swagger files exist without a matching version in TypeSpec, you can suppress this error by adding an entry to suppressions.yaml in your service's spec folder (not the global one).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLonger-term, the goal is to eliminate swagger files entirely, but for now, swagger and TypeSpec coexist. So:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKeep only the latest preview in .tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKeep older generated swagger for 90 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdd suppressions if needed to prevent TypeSpec validation from failing\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"dev#mgmt#operation_migration.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/mgmt/operation_migration.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\\n## Why These Changes?\\\\\\\\n# dev#mgmt#operation_migration.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Why These Changes?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur operations prioritize consistency with the underlying REST API:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Better API Alignment**: Keyword-only parameters improve traceability between code and request body.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Improved Developer Experience**: Keyword-only parameters enable IDEs to provide rich type hints with parameter names.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Maintainability**: Enum-based conditions makes the SDK easier to maintain and understand.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you encounter issues not covered here, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues) with tag `emitter:client:python`.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"emitters#clients#introduction.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Client Emitters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/introduction\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Client Emitters\\\\\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\\\\\n# emitters#clients#introduction.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Client Emitters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cAside\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**All client emitters are in preview**.

Can we remove this model? (omit-unreachable-types: true does not work)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the `OkResponse` model is being emitted but not actually referenced, that does sound like a bug \\\\u2014 we shouldn't be generating unused models. Especially in cases like this where you're doing a long-running POST action and the 200 response is effectively empty, it\\\\u2019s more accurate to model the operation with just a `202` and an error response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor your case, you can avoid using `OkResponse` entirely by switching to `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync` or passing `never` as the third argument. That will prevent the generation of the unnecessary `OkResponse` model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, keep in mind that for LROs, the POST operation typically doesn't return 200 anyway. That response is just a placeholder in the old pattern to signal \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"void\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". If you're converting from existing Swagger, and it doesn\\\\u2019t actually return 200, you should be able to safely drop that response from the Swagger and avoid the breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, if you do need to customize the final response for the LRO, `getLroResponse` can be used to override the response returned at the end of the operation \\\\u2014 no need to rely on `OkResponse` at all.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n# TSP Install fails with below error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## question \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am trying to install TSP and its dependencies and it fails with below error.

For these scenarios, you can use the [`namespace` configuration option](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/emitter/#namespace) in your `tspconfig.yaml` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you want the published SDK to follow closely with the package structure and namespaces in your TypeSpec file, you should also pass in the `package-name` flag with the desired value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Using the `namespace` Flag\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `namespace` option allows you to specify where the generated code should be placed within your package structure. This is particularly useful for cases where you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Keep generated code isolated in a dedicated subdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.

Ensure that each link text is unique or only appears once per docstring.\\\\n   - If you need multiple links, use different link texts or combine them into a single sentence.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Unexpected Indentation and Unindent Errors:**\\\\n   - These are typically caused by inconsistent indentation in doc comments or by starting/ending lists or block quotes without blank lines.\\\\n   - Always start block comments and lists with a blank line, and end them with a blank line.\\\\n   - Avoid mixing markdown constructs (lists, quotes, code blocks) without clear separation.\\\\n\\\\n4. **ServiceTier Union Formatting:**\\\\n   - For unions like `ServiceTier`, if you have a doc comment with a bullet list, ensure it is formatted as described above. For example:\\\\n     ```typespec\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * Service tier options:\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - auto\\\\n      * - default\\\\n      * - flex\\\\n      * - scale\\\\n      * - priority\\\\n      */\\\\n     union ServiceTier {\\\\n       \\\\\\\"auto\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"flex\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"scale\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"priority\\\\\\\",\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n\\\\n5. **Response Model Documentation:**\\\\n   - For the `Response` model, review all doc comments for properties and the model itself. Ensure that any lists, code blocks, or block quotes are separated by blank lines and properly indented.\\\\n   - If you have nested documentation, keep indentation consistent and avoid starting a new markdown construct immediately after another without a blank line.\\\\n\\\\n6. **General TypeSpec Docstring Best Practices:**\\\\n   - Use the TypeSpec formatter to ensure consistent indentation and layout ([see style guide](https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide)).\\\\n   - Use block comments (`/** ... */`) for multi-line documentation and ensure markdown constructs are separated by blank lines.\\\\n   - Avoid duplicate link texts and ensure all markdown is valid CommonMark.\\\\n\\\\n**Next steps:**\\\\n- Update your TypeSpec files to follow these documentation formatting rules.\\\\n- Re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python docs (`tox run -e sphinx ...`).\\\\n- If errors persist, check the generated Python docstrings for problematic markdown and adjust your TypeSpec comments accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach will resolve the Sphinx docstring errors and ensure your Python SDK documentation builds cleanly.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\\\\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\\\\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\\\\nHere are practical steps:\\\\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\\\\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\\\\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\\\\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\\\\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\\\\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\\\\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nsphinx = false\\\\n```\\\"}\"}]",
