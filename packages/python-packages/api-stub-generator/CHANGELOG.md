# Release History

## Version 0.2.9 (Unreleased)
Fixed issue where Python 3-style type hints stopped displaying
  their inner types.
Fixed issue where docstring annotations were preferred over
  Python 2-style type hints for return types. Since docstrings
  have a 2-line limit, this preference didn't make sense.

## Version 0.2.8 (Unreleased)
Kwargs that were previously displayed as "type = ..." will now
  be displayed as "Optional[type] = ..." to align with syntax
  from Python type hints.
Fixed issue where variadic arguments appeared a singular argument.
Fixes issue where default values were no longer displayed.

## Version 0.2.7 (Unreleased)
Updated version to regenerate all reviews using Python 3.9

## Version 0.2.6 (Unreleased)

  info wraps onto a second line.
Fixed issue where ivar type was not properly parsed from
  the docstring.
Fixed issue where typehint parsing was too strict and required
  spaces.
