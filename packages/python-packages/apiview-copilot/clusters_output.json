    "summary": "This cluster focuses on improving how APIView generates, retains, and surfaces revisions across PR, automatic, released, and major/minor versions, ensuring correct 'latest' selection and preventing unintended deletion. It adds better discoverability and transparency via permalinks, notifications, accurate metadata (e.g., Last Updated), changelogs/What's New, and static links, plus tooling/APIs for token retrieval and samples inclusion. It also covers policy changes (e.g., forcing revisions on version bumps/dependency-only changes), release info updates, and migration of legacy models to V2.",
