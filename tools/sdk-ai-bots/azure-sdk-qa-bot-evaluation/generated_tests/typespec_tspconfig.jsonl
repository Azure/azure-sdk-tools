{"testcase": "is sdk generation required for private preview?", "query": "title: is sdk generation required for private preview?\n\nquestion: we are trying to get our api approved for a private preview, but our preview customers do not require an SDK. We were hoping to onboard to SDK later.\nI'm a bit confused. Does api approval always include SDK? If not, how do we setup tspconfig to validate.\nwe are creating an arm api / not dataplane. I've seen some tspconfig.yaml without sdk configs, but when i try removing them I encounter tsv failures.", "ground_truth": "API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\n\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\n\nThe correct and supported approach is:\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\n\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\n```\n\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\n\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation in tspconfig.yaml until you are ready to onboard SDKs.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "Azure Service Versioning Guide | Positive Consequences of the Azure Service Definition", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Azure-Service-Versioning-Guideline"}, {"title": "Create a pull request with your Azure REST API spec update | Before you begin", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-specs-pr"}, {"title": "Can required fields have default values? | answer", "link": ""}, {"title": "Process", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Deprecating-Preview-APIs"}, {"title": "Oav generate-examples failed | answer", "link": ""}, {"title": "Migrate ARM spec | Initial pass through checklist", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/checklists/migrate-arm-tips"}, {"title": "having trouble with examples not matching @pattern rules in github actions | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec | Conversion process | Identify the OpenAPI spec version to convert", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec-conversion"}, {"title": "Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy V1.3.2 | Service Versioning Workflow", "link": ""}, {"title": "bad | Implementation details", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "Client Emitters | How to Use Emitters to Generate HTTP Clients from TypeSpec | Introduction", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/introduction"}, {"title": "SDK generation configuration | Swagger to SDK", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-spec-gen-sdk-config"}, {"title": "Migrate data-plane specs | Initial pass through checklist", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/checklists/migrate-dp-tips"}, {"title": "After migration - in data-plane/DynamicSessions/tspconfig.yaml", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Resolving-Folder-Migration-Conflicts:-A-Guide-for-PR-Authors"}, {"title": "Usage | Prerequisites", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-with-tsp-client/intro_tsp_client"}, {"title": "SDK generation configuration", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-spec-gen-sdk-config"}, {"title": "Azure Service Versioning Guide | An Azure Resource Provider and its 1+ Azure Services", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Azure-Service-Versioning-Guideline"}, {"title": "good", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "TypeSpec | `AvoidAnonymousParameter` | resource-manager", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff"}, {"title": "Getting started with TypeSpec server code generation for JavaScript | Prerequisites", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/code-generation-javascript"}, {"title": "Table of Contents | Common Error Fix Guidance | Import Resolution Errors", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/SDK-Validation"}, {"title": "Generating readme and examples files | answer", "link": ""}, {"title": "SecurityDefinitionsStructure error on PR | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "Validation Rule Suppression | Suppressing SdkTspConfigValidation Rules | Suppress Specific Sub-rules within SdkTspConfigValidation", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation"}, {"title": "Rules | SdkTspConfigValidation | JavaScript Sub Rules", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation"}, {"title": "Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "SDK Generation failure | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "TypeSpec AutoRest Library | Configuration | Emitter options:", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/emitters/typespec-autorest/index"}, {"title": "Migrate ARM spec | Initial pass through checklist", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/checklists/migrate-arm-tips"}], "expected_references": [{"title": "Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "Can required fields have default values? | answer", "link": ""}, {"title": "Validation Rule Suppression | Suppressing SdkTspConfigValidation Rules | Suppress Specific Sub-rules within SdkTspConfigValidation", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation"}]}
