The service enables secure operations on secrets with CRUD functionality alongside additional capabilities such as backup, restoration, soft-delete recovery, purge, and rolling of secrets. It also facilitates direct HTTP interactions with vault endpoints, ensuring robust secret management and integration with secure token credentials.\\n\\n## API Version\\nThe API is governed by an ApiVersion enumeration that lists supported versions. The latest API version in this enumeration is V7_7_preview_1.\\n\\n## Client Classes\\nThe API exposes both synchronous and asynchronous client classes named SecretClient in the azure.keyvault.secrets namespace and in the azure.keyvault.secrets.aio namespace, respectively. These client classes provide equivalent functionalities, allowing architects to choose between synchronous and asynchronous programming models based on the application’s requirements.\\n\\n## Functional Overview\\nThe SecretClient classes offer comprehensive support for managing secrets in a key vault, including CRUD operations along with functionalities such as secret backup, deletion, recovery, restoration, purging, and rolling. Additionally, these clients enable listing of secret properties and versions while supporting custom HTTP requests for advanced interactions. The API design ensures secure communication with the vault through proper credential management and distributed tracing mechanisms."
