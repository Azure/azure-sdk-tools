The correct, type-safe way is `Record<string>`, which will be emitted to OpenAPI/Swagger as an `object` with `additionalProperties: { type: \"string\" }`.\nIf your API spec review asks for a 'model', you can define a named type:\n```\nmodel MetadataModel is Record<string>;\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\nmetadata?: MetadataModel;\n}\n```\nBut `Record<string>` is the canonical, recommended approach for a string-to-string dictionary in TypeSpec ARM resource definitions.\nNote: While this is technically correct, ARM guidelines recommend against unbounded dictionary/object types unless absolutely necessary, as they can limit Azure Policy and ARG capabilities.
