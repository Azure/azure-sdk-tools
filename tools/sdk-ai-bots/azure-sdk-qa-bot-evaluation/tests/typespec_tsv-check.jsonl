Currently there is one failure related to hardware.json (autogenerated OpenAPI file) having been modified. But the changes to hardware.json are to prevent other linter errors. The change to add readOnly to provisioningState was needed, as without it the Swagger LintDiff check failed asking to make it readOnly, and these changes were suggested by the representative in the ARM Office hours to work around the error. The other change in hardware.json is to add example for Preview API, which is subscription level API. the example markup was not getting auto-generated in the swagger json, so it needed to be added manually to prevent another swagger check of missing example from failing. Need some guidance to work around these errors.\nFor these specific errors, not sure if there is a way to mark example files for subscription level API or suppress errors for these APIs, and also, any way to mark provisioningState readOnly in tsp file (note, the instance was already marked as readOnly, but the error is around marking the type as readOnly.\nThanks!", "ground_truth": "You should NOT manually edit the autogenerated hardware.json file to work around TypeSpec or linter errors. Instead, you must address these issues at the TypeSpec source level and via configuration, following Azure TypeSpec best practices.\n1.ProvisioningState Must Be ReadOnly: The LintDiff check for `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` is triggered because the validation expects the type schema referenced by `provisioningState` to be `readOnly`, not just the property instance. The recommended (and officially supported) solution is to update your `tspconfig.yaml` to set:\n```\noptions:\n\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\":\nuse-read-only-status-schema: true\n```\nThis ensures all `ProvisioningState` schemas are emitted as `readOnly`, resolving the LintDiff error at the TypeSpec emission layer and removing the need to edit the generated Swagger.\n2.Missing Examples for Subscription-level APIs: The OpenAPI validation (ModelValidation) requires an example for each operation, including subscription-level (preview) APIs. If auto-generation tools like OAV are not generating examples for these, you must:\nManually add a valid example JSON file in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder of your TypeSpec project, ensuring the `operationId` matches your operation.\nThere is currently NO supported way to suppress example requirements in TypeSpec or Swagger for missing examples. Suppression can sometimes be done via labels (like `Approved-ModelValidation`) to unblock a PR, but the recommended approach is to provide at least one example per operation.\nGeneral Best Practices:\nDo NOT edit the emitted Swagger (`hardware.json`). Always make changes at the TypeSpec or configuration level.\nIf you encounter TypeSpec validation failures, refer to the TypeSpec source, emitter options, or required supporting files (such as examples or suppressions.yaml for certain rule types). For LintDiff, suppressions must be done in `readme.md` or `suppressions.yaml` (for TypeSpecRequirement errors only, not LintDiff or example requirements).\nSummary:\nSet `use-read-only-status-schema: true` in `tspconfig.yaml` to resolve the `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` error.\nAdd missing example files for all operations, including subscription-level ones, as there is no suppression for missing examples.\nNever edit the generated OpenAPI files to workaround linter errors.\nLet me know if you need guidance on creating an example file or configuring the emitter options.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "`ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` lintdiff violation in TypeSpec for ARM Service", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/status-read-only-error"}, {"title": "TypeSpec Validation failed", "link": ""}, {"title": "Typespec Validation required check", "link": ""}, {"title": "Typespec Validation issue", "link": ""}, {"title": "Running Locally", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/API-Spec-Review-FAQ"}, {"title": "bad", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "Azure REST API, SDK development process with TypeSpec", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Azure-REST-API,-SDK-development-process-with-TypeSpec"}, {"title": "Resolving Pipeline Failures", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/pipeline"}, {"title": "`ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` lintdiff violation in TypeSpec for ARM Service", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/status-read-only-error"}, {"title": "`ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` lintdiff violation in TypeSpec for ARM Service", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/status-read-only-error"}, {"title": "ARM Rules, TypeSpec Linting, and Suppression", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/arm-rules"}, {"title": "TypeSpec", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff"}, {"title": "arm-resource-provisioning-state", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-resource-manager/rules/arm-resource-provisioning-state"}, {"title": "Use tools to create and validate Azure REST APIs specs", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-tooling"}, {"title": "Suppress validation failures on a PR", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "Fixing Converted TypeSpec", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/conversionfix"}, {"title": "additional  \"readOnly\": true in ProvisioningState", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "bad", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "bad", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "No set in property", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "Swagger LintDiff validation for certain models", "link": ""}, {"title": "Output folder 'ContentUnderstanding' appears to contain TypeSpec-generated swagger files, not generated from the current TypeSpec sources.
