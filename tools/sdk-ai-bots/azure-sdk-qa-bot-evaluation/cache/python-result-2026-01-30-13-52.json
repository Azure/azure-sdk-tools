This error occurs because the test proxy uses a self-signed certificate, which may not be correctly configured or trusted in your environment, especially for async tests.\n\nTo resolve this issue and successfully run your live tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Update your branch to the latest main**: Ensure your local branch includes the latest changes from the main branch of the Azure SDK for Python repo. The test proxy certificate is occasionally rotated, and having the latest version helps avoid certificate mismatches.\n\n2. **If the error persists (especially for async tests)**: This is likely due to an async-specific environment issue with SSL certificate handling. As a workaround, unset the `PROXY_URL` environment variable so that the test proxy defaults to HTTP (`http://localhost:5000`), which does not require certificate verification.\n\n   For example, in your shell or `.env` file, remove or comment out the line setting `PROXY_URL` to the HTTPS endpoint.\n\n3. **If you require HTTPS for your tests**: If your tests must use HTTPS, and the above steps do not resolve the issue, reach out to the Azure SDK team for further assistance, as async environments can nondeterministically fail with SSL verification.\n\nIn summary, for most cases, switching to the HTTP endpoint by unsetting `PROXY_URL` will allow your async live tests to run without SSL certificate errors.",

This error occurs because the test proxy uses a self-signed certificate, which may not be correctly configured or trusted in your environment, especially for async tests.\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this issue and successfully run your live tests, follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Update your branch to the latest main**: Ensure your local branch includes the latest changes from the main branch of the Azure SDK for Python repo. The test proxy certificate is occasionally rotated, and having the latest version helps avoid certificate mismatches.\\\\n\\\\n2. **If the error persists (especially for async tests)**: This is likely due to an async-specific environment issue with SSL certificate handling. As a workaround, unset the `PROXY_URL` environment variable so that the test proxy defaults to HTTP (`http://localhost:5000`), which does not require certificate verification.\\\\n\\\\n   For example, in your shell or `.env` file, remove or comment out the line setting `PROXY_URL` to the HTTPS endpoint.\\\\n\\\\n3. **If you require HTTPS for your tests**: If your tests must use HTTPS, and the above steps do not resolve the issue, reach out to the Azure SDK team for further assistance, as async environments can nondeterministically fail with SSL verification.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, for most cases, switching to the HTTP endpoint by unsetting `PROXY_URL` will allow your async live tests to run without SSL certificate errors.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You're encountering an SSL certificate error when running live tests for async APIs, specifically when connecting to https://localhost:5001.

Go to [Azure DevOps - Azure SDK Internal Project](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build)\n2. Search for the pipeline named `python - resource` or similar, as the pipeline is named according to the service directory for management SDKs.\n3.

            "answer": "Your pipeline is failing due to unresolved relative imports in your TypeSpec files (e.g., '../Discovery.Shared/namespace.tsp'). This is a common issue when TypeSpec files import other files from sibling or parent directories that aren't automatically included in the TypeSpec compilation context.\n\nTo resolve these `import-not-found` errors, you need to specify the additional directories containing the imported TypeSpec files in your configuration. For Azure SDK pipelines, this is typically done by adding an `additionalDirectories` entry to your `tsp-location.yaml` (or equivalent config used by the generation tool).\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n1. Locate your `tsp-location.yaml` (or the config file used for TypeSpec generation).\n2. Add an `additionalDirectories` array listing the relative paths to all folders containing the imported `.tsp` files. For example:\n\n```yaml\ndirectory: specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Workspace\ncommit: <your-commit-sha>\nrepo: Azure/azure-rest-api-specs\nadditionalDirectories:\n  - specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Shared\n```\n\n3. Ensure the paths are relative to the repo root and point to the folders containing the missing files (not the files themselves).\n4. Re-run the pipeline or the generation command. The TypeSpec compiler will now be able to resolve the relative imports.\n\n**Reference Error Pattern:**\n- `error import-not-found: Couldn't resolve import '../Discovery.Shared/namespace.tsp'`\n\n**Reference Solution:**\n- Add the path to the folder containing the imported `.tsp` files to the `additionalDirectories` setting in your config.\n\nThis should resolve the import errors and allow your Python SDK generation to proceed.",

Configuration\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n# handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Configuration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration can be provided via the `tspconfig.yaml` configuration file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec compiler will look for the closest `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the same directory or closest parent directory from the TypeSpec entrypoint.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example if running `tsp compile /dev/foo/bar/main.tsp`, the compiler will lookup the file at the folllowing paths (in order):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/bar/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Schema\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe file is a `yaml` document with the following structure. See the [next section](#typespec-configuration-options) for details on each option.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel TypeSpecProjectSchema {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameters?: Record\\\\\\\\u003c{default: string}\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `environment-variables`?: Record\\\\\\\\u003c{default: string}\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `warn-as-error`?: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `output-dir`?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `trace`?: string | string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  imports?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emit?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `dry-run`?: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  options?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  linter?: LinterConfig;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel LinterConfig {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends?: RuleRef[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  enable?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cRuleRef, boolean\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  disable?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cRuleRef, string\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Extending Project Files\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere may be instances where you want to build different folders with varying options (such as different emitters), but still want to share some common configurations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, you can use the `extends` property in the configuration file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, in `\\\\\\\\u003cmy-pkg\\\\\\\\u003e/tspconfig.yaml`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    some-option: my-name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    some-other-option: This is a title\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin `\\\\\\\\u003cmy-pkg\\\\\\\\u003e/proj2/tspconfig.yaml`, enable `emitter1` using the options specified in the parent `tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=proj2/tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What gets extended\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe extending logic follows these rules:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Root-level properties**: Shallow merge for all properties except `options`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Options property**: Deep merge at one level (per emitter)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Override behavior**: Properties specified in the extending file will completely override those from the extended file\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Root-level merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen extending a configuration, most properties (like `emit`, `imports`, `trace`, etc.) are merged at the root level. If the same property exists in both files, the extending file's value completely replaces the extended file's value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Options merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `options` property receives special treatment with a one-level deep merge:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Different emitters from both files are combined\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- If the same emitter is configured in both files, the extending file's emitter configuration completely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ncompletely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:   # Completely replaces emitter1 options\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-c: value-c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter3:   # Added alongside emitter2 from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-y: value-y\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Resulting merged config:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// emit: [emitter3]  # Only emitter3, emitter1 is gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// options:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter1: { option-c: value-c }  # Only option-c, option-a and option-b are gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter2: { option-x: value-x }  # Inherited from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter3: { option-y: value-y }  # From extending config\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Variable interpolation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec project file provides variable interpolation using:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- config file parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- emitter options can reference each other\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nVariable interpolation is done using an variable expression surrounded by `{` and `}`. (`{\\\\\\\\u003cexpression\\\\\\\\u003e}`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExamples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `{output-dir}/my-path`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `{env.SHARED_PATH}/my-path`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Interpolation of Emitter Path Config\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nemitter                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `service-name`             | service name             | Name of the service                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `service-name-if-multiple` | service name if multiple | Name of the service if multiple, undefined if one                                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Project Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can define certain parameters that can subsequently be specified through the CLI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nParameters can be organized in a nested structure, to access different levels of the structure, use dots (`.`) in the variable expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTherefore, parameter names should not contain `.` in their name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be utilized in the default value of these parameters.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese parameters can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll parameters must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  base-dir:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {base-dir}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe parameter can then be specified via `--arg` in this format `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` and for nested structures `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e.\\\\\\\\u003cnested-parameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntsp compile . --arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"base-dir=/path/to/base\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can specify which environment variables it can interpolate.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be used in the default value of these environment variables.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese environment variables can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression, using the `env.` prefix.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll environment variables must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenvironment-variables:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  BASE_DIR:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {env.BASE_DIR}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Emitter Options\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCertain emitter configurations can be interpolated using a specific rule designed to collapse a path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a variable is succeeded by a `/` or `.` and the emitter responsible for interpolating the config doesn't supply that variable, the path segment will be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, consider the following config value: `{service-name}/output.{version}.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's what would be produced:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Service name value | Version value | Result                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`        | `PetStore/output.v1.json` |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `undefined`   | `PetStore/output.json`    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Variable name              | Scope                    | Description

This guide helps you identify, review, and resolve breaking changes that may occur in new SDK versions due to migration of service specifications from Swagger to TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBreaking changes can be resolved by:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Client Customizations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nClient customizations should be implemented in a file named `client.tsp` located in the service's specification directory alongside the main entry point `main.tsp`. This `client.tsp` becomes the new specification entry point, so import `main.tsp` in the `client.tsp` file. **Do not** import `client.tsp` in the `main.tsp` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Add your customizations here\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. TypeSpec Configuration Changes\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration changes should be made in the `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the service's specification directory. This file is used to configure the TypeSpec compiler and client generator options.

Find (or add) the row for azure-ai-transcription in python-packages.csv.\n2. Set the MSDocService field to \"cognitive-services\". This value is used to correctly categorize the package in the Learn docs hierarchy.\n3. Ensure other relevant fields (ServiceName, DisplayName, Type, etc.) are filled in appropriately.\nAfter updating the CSV, commit and create a PR in the azure-sdk repo. Once merged, the next docs build will pick up the new metadata and your package will be categorized correctly.\nIf the Notes field for your package is set to \"Needs Review\", update it to another value to avoid automation overwriting your changes.\nReferences and field details can be found here:\n- [CSV field README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\n- [Relevant CSV file for Python packages](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/_data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv)\nIn summary: Yes, registering your package in the metadata CSV with MSDocService: cognitive-services is required.

            "answer": "Yes, the issue is caused by missing or incorrect metadata registration for your package in the metadata CSV, specifically the MSDocService field. To ensure your documentation appears under the correct 'cognitive-services' category on Microsoft Learn, you must register your package in the metadata CSV (located at _data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv) and set the MSDocService field to 'cognitive-services'.\n\nThe documentation build system uses the MSDocService value to categorize packages in the table of contents and folder structure on Microsoft Learn. If this field is missing or incorrect, your package will appear under the 'unknown' folder or 'Other > Uncategorized' section. After updating the CSV, run the documentation automation again to propagate the changes.\n\nActionable steps:\n1.

This guide expands on how Azure Services should define Preview versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Preview Versioning Rules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Always make the last enum the preview and apply `@previewVersion` to it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Apply `@added(Versions.PreviewVersion)` to all preview items - these items will not show up in any GA Version\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For a new GA, add a new version enum **BEFORE** the preview enum value. Manually change all **preview** items that are GA'ing so that the `@added` version value matches the new GA enum value\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For any items remaining in **preview**, rename the **old preview** enum value to the **new preview** enum value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### New preview Version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the following example we introduce a new preview version called `v3Preview` which includes everything from `v2` plus adds a new property to the `Widget` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`diff

You'll need to\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\\\\\\\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*before* releasing.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays. If your data is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnot updated and you don't want to wait, [run the job manually](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=1284).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis will update the metadata PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you find anything unexpected in the table of contents or service README, check the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[metadata CSV file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/tree/main/_data/releases/latest) to ensure that the metadata is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncorrect. If the metadata is not correct, open a PR with corrections.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nduring business hours on weekdays.

If the metadata is not correct, open a PR with corrections.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOnce merged your changes will be released on the next available documentation release.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n##### Update a published Package-level Overview\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e For packages released using the Azure SDK EngSys, changes need to be synchronized between the source SDK repo and the docs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e repo. Changes to the docs repo that are not mirrored to the source SDK repo will be overwritten by content from the source\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e SDK repo on the next package release.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Find the Package-level overview using the table from [Package-level overviews](#package-level-overviews).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Find the corresponding README.md file for the library in the SDK repo (e.g. [azure-sdk-for-net](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net)).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Update the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"front matter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" date field at the beginning of the file to today's date. To update other front matter metadata, see [Ensure CSV metadata is correct](#ensure-csv-metadata-is-correct).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Copy changed content from step 2 into the Package-level overview from step 1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n5.

            "answer": "The \"black\" job in the Azure SDK for Python pipeline can fail for reasons beyond just code formatting. Even if running \"black\" locally with the same version (24.4.0) does not produce changes, there are a few areas to check for a root cause:\n1. Run Black with the Same Arguments as the Pipeline:The pipeline runs \"black\" using tox with specific arguments. Make sure you are running locally in the same way. From the official guidance, run: `tox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .` This ensures that the same config files, paths, and excludes are used. The pipeline may use a different configuration or target files that you are not formatting locally. Or you can tried the same command used by ci: `python -m azpysdk.main black --isolate sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects`.\n2. Check for Hidden Files or Config Differences: The pipeline uses the repository\u2019s configuration, including pyproject.toml and any exclude/include patterns. Local runs may inadvertently skip files due to local ignore files, environment differences, or working directory mismatches. Double-check that your local environment matches the CI context.\n3. Run `git status` or `git diff` to find out whether there are files already formatted but not pushed to the pr.\n4. Line Endings and Whitespace: Sometimes, black fails due to line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) or invisible whitespace issues that are not flagged locally. Make sure your files have consistent line endings (prefer LF in repo).\n5. Check the Pipeline Log for Specific Files: Review the pipeline's failure log closely to see which files are reported as needing formatting. Sometimes, it\u2019s a file outside your typical working set (such as generated code or test files).\n6. Reproduce in a Clean Environment: To eliminate local state issues, clone your repo in a fresh directory and re-run the pipeline\u2019s black command as above. If you confirm that running \"black\" via tox in a clean environment with the same version does not report changes, but the pipeline still fails, check for possible pipeline caching or artifact issues. Otherwise, use the pipeline log to identify exactly which file is causing the failure and focus on that file. Removing the check is not recommended; instead, focus on aligning your local runs with the pipeline invocation. If you continue to see unexplained failures, reach out in the Azure SDK language team channel with your findings and the specific pipeline log excerpt.",

            "answer": "The 'black' job in the Azure pipeline can fail even if running 'black' locally (with the same version, e.g., 24.4.0) does not make any changes. This is typically caused by differences in the environment or invocation parameters between your local setup and the CI pipeline. Common causes include:\n\n1. **Line endings (LF vs CRLF):** The pipeline may be running on a different OS or with different git settings, causing line ending mismatches. Black enforces consistent line endings, so files checked out with CRLF locally but LF in CI can trigger failures. To fix this, add a `.gitattributes` file to your repo or test directory to enforce LF line endings:\n\n```\n* text=auto eol=lf\n```\n\n2. **Black invocation arguments:** The pipeline may run black with specific arguments (e.g., target paths, exclude/include patterns) that differ from your local invocation. Make sure you run black locally with the same arguments as the pipeline. You can check the pipeline logs for the exact command used.\n\n3. **Uncommitted changes or staged files:** Ensure all files are committed before running black locally, as the pipeline always runs on the committed state.\n\n**Recommended steps to resolve:**\n- Add a `.gitattributes` file with `* text=auto eol=lf` to enforce LF line endings.\n- Ensure you run black locally with the same version and arguments as the pipeline.\n- Commit all changes and re-run black locally before pushing.\n- If the issue persists, check the pipeline logs for the exact files and differences reported by black.\n\nDo not remove the black check from the pipeline; instead, align your local environment and invocation with the pipeline to ensure consistent results.",

A few hours ago I found out that I can turn on this check in the pipeline. I was happy to see this. So I added the following to pyproject.toml:\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nblack = true\\\\n```\\\\nI run \\\\\\\"black\\\\\\\" before commiting my last change to the PR, and no updates were needed.\\\\nBut the pipeline called out a \\\\\\\"black\\\\\\\" failure: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/results?buildId=5606772&view=logs&j=b70e5e73-bbb6-5567-0939-8415943fadb9&t=efe9ac6d-3fdb-50af-24e1-4319f36eecb4\\\\nI see the pipeline used black version 24.4.0. I had a newer version when I run locally. I install 24.4.0 and run that, but it also did not do any changes to the code.\\\\nAny idea how to fix it? (other than removing it from the pipeline...).\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"The 'black' job in the Azure pipeline can fail even if running 'black' locally (with the same version, e.g., 24.4.0) does not make any changes. This is typically caused by differences in the environment or invocation parameters between your local setup and the CI pipeline. Common causes include:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Line endings (LF vs CRLF):** The pipeline may be running on a different OS or with different git settings, causing line ending mismatches. Black enforces consistent line endings, so files checked out with CRLF locally but LF in CI can trigger failures. To fix this, add a `.gitattributes` file to your repo or test directory to enforce LF line endings:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n* text=auto eol=lf\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n2. **Black invocation arguments:** The pipeline may run black with specific arguments (e.g., target paths, exclude/include patterns) that differ from your local invocation. Make sure you run black locally with the same arguments as the pipeline. You can check the pipeline logs for the exact command used.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Uncommitted changes or staged files:** Ensure all files are committed before running black locally, as the pipeline always runs on the committed state.\\\\n\\\\n**Recommended steps to resolve:**\\\\n- Add a `.gitattributes` file with `* text=auto eol=lf` to enforce LF line endings.\\\\n- Ensure you run black locally with the same version and arguments as the pipeline.\\\\n- Commit all changes and re-run black locally before pushing.\\\\n- If the issue persists, check the pipeline logs for the exact files and differences reported by black.\\\\n\\\\nDo not remove the black check from the pipeline; instead, align your local environment and invocation with the pipeline to ensure consistent results.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The \\\\\\\"black\\\\\\\" job in the Azure SDK for Python pipeline can fail for reasons beyond just code formatting. Even if running \\\\\\\"black\\\\\\\" locally with the same version (24.4.0) does not produce changes, there are a few areas to check for a root cause:\\\\n1. Run Black with the Same Arguments as the Pipeline:The pipeline runs \\\\\\\"black\\\\\\\" using tox with specific arguments. Make sure you are running locally in the same way. From the official guidance, run: `tox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .` This ensures that the same config files, paths, and excludes are used. The pipeline may use a different configuration or target files that you are not formatting locally. Or you can tried the same command used by ci: `python -m azpysdk.main black --isolate sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects`.\\\\n2. Check for Hidden Files or Config Differences: The pipeline uses the repository\\\\u2019s configuration, including pyproject.toml and any exclude/include patterns. Local runs may inadvertently skip files due to local ignore files, environment differences, or working directory mismatches. Double-check that your local environment matches the CI context.\\\\n3. Run `git status` or `git diff` to find out whether there are files already formatted but not pushed to the pr.\\\\n4. Line Endings and Whitespace: Sometimes, black fails due to line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) or invisible whitespace issues that are not flagged locally. Make sure your files have consistent line endings (prefer LF in repo).\\\\n5. Check the Pipeline Log for Specific Files: Review the pipeline's failure log closely to see which files are reported as needing formatting. Sometimes, it\\\\u2019s a file outside your typical working set (such as generated code or test files).\\\\n6. Reproduce in a Clean Environment: To eliminate local state issues, clone your repo in a fresh directory and re-run the pipeline\\\\u2019s black command as above. If you confirm that running \\\\\\\"black\\\\\\\" via tox in a clean environment with the same version does not report changes, but the pipeline still fails, check for possible pipeline caching or artifact issues. Otherwise, use the pipeline log to identify exactly which file is causing the failure and focus on that file. Removing the check is not recommended; instead, focus on aligning your local runs with the pipeline invocation.

            "answer": "The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\nHere are practical steps:\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\n```\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\nsphinx = false\n```",

            "answer": "To resolve the Sphinx docstring errors and warnings in your emitted Python SDK, you need to update your TypeSpec documentation comments and formatting to ensure compatibility with Sphinx/reStructuredText parsing rules. The main issues stem from how block quotes, bullet lists, and indentation are rendered from TypeSpec doc comments into Python docstrings.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n1. **Review and Update TypeSpec Doc Comments:**\n   - Ensure that any block quotes, bullet lists, or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments follow [CommonMark markdown](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation) and avoid ambiguous indentation or missing blank lines.\n   - For bullet lists, always add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure consistent indentation.\n   - For block quotes, ensure a blank line after the block before any new section starts.\n   - Avoid duplicate explicit target names (e.g., multiple links with the same label like \"learn more\").\n\n2. **Example Fixes:**\n   - If you have a doc comment like:\n     ```\n     /**\n      * This is a summary.\n      * - item one\n      * - item two\n      * More details.\n      */\n     ```\n     Update it to:\n     ```\n     /**\n      * This is a summary.\n      *\n      * - item one\n      * - item two\n      *\n      * More details.\n      */\n     ```\n   - For block quotes, ensure:\n     ```\n     /**\n      * > This is a block quote.\n      *\n      * Next paragraph.\n      */\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for Indentation Issues:**\n   - Sphinx expects consistent indentation in docstrings. If your TypeSpec doc comments have inconsistent indentation, fix them so that all lines align properly.\n\n4. **Union Types and Enum Documentation:**\n   - For unions like `ServiceTier`, if you want to document the options, use a doc comment above the union and format the list with blank lines:\n     ```\n     /**\n      * Service tier options:\n      *\n      * - auto\n      * - default\n      * - flex\n      * - scale\n      * - priority\n      */\n     union ServiceTier {\n       \"auto\",\n       \"default\",\n       \"flex\",\n       \"scale\",\n       \"priority\",\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **General Style:**\n   - Follow the [TypeSpec style guide](https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide) for comment and block formatting.\n   - Use the built-in TypeSpec formatter to ensure consistent output.\n\n6. **Regenerate and Validate:**\n   - After updating your TypeSpec files, re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python SDK docs. The Sphinx warnings/errors should be resolved if the doc comments are properly formatted.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe errors are caused by markdown formatting in TypeSpec doc comments that do not translate cleanly to Sphinx/reStructuredText. By ensuring blank lines around lists and block quotes, avoiding duplicate link targets, and maintaining consistent indentation, you can eliminate these warnings and errors in your Python SDK documentation build.\n\nIf you continue to see issues, review the generated Python docstrings directly and compare them to Sphinx's [supported docstring formats](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md) for further adjustments.",

By ensuring blank lines around lists and block quotes, avoiding duplicate link targets, and maintaining consistent indentation, you can eliminate these warnings and errors in your Python SDK documentation build.\\\\n\\\\nIf you continue to see issues, review the generated Python docstrings directly and compare them to Sphinx's [supported docstring formats](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md) for further adjustments.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\\\\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\\\\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\\\\nHere are practical steps:\\\\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\\\\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\\\\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\\\\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\\\\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\\\\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\\\\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nsphinx = false\\\\n```\\\"}\"}]",

Since nextLink is optional, adding it is not a breaking change. This ensures that if paging is implemented later, it follows the standard. Ultimately, the solution agreed upon is to add nextLink and use the core paging schema in TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```diff\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#suppress \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core/documentation-required\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"For backward compatibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- model ListAppIdResponse is Azure.Core.Page\\\\\\\\u003cAppId\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+ model ListAppIdResponse {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    /*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    * List of AppIds\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    @TypeSpec.pageItems\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    value: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    /*\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    * next Link\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    @TypeSpec.nextLink\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    nextLink?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+ }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```diff\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Documentation\\\\\\\\n## Markdown\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#documentation.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Markdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec Documentation support CommonMark markdown formatting.

The guidance I got from API board a month ago is that main.tsp should only list the latest preview. API version  But doing so triggered this error. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nShould this be an error?  Or can we make this into a warning instead?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should only track the latest preview version in your TypeSpec files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf there are older preview Swagger files still in the repo, they can remain there for the required 90-day deprecation window, even if they're no longer listed in your .tsp files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhile TypeSpec validation currently throws an error if Swagger files exist without a matching version in TypeSpec, you can suppress this error by adding an entry to suppressions.yaml in your service's spec folder (not the global one).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLonger-term, the goal is to eliminate swagger files entirely, but for now, swagger and TypeSpec coexist. So:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKeep only the latest preview in .tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKeep older generated swagger for 90 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdd suppressions if needed to prevent TypeSpec validation from failing\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"dev#mgmt#operation_migration.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/mgmt/operation_migration.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\\n## Why These Changes?\\\\\\\\n# dev#mgmt#operation_migration.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Why These Changes?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur operations prioritize consistency with the underlying REST API:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Better API Alignment**: Keyword-only parameters improve traceability between code and request body.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Improved Developer Experience**: Keyword-only parameters enable IDEs to provide rich type hints with parameter names.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Maintainability**: Enum-based conditions makes the SDK easier to maintain and understand.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you encounter issues not covered here, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues) with tag `emitter:client:python`.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"emitters#clients#introduction.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Client Emitters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/introduction\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Client Emitters\\\\\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\\\\\n# emitters#clients#introduction.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Client Emitters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cAside\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**All client emitters are in preview**.

Can we remove this model? (omit-unreachable-types: true does not work)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the `OkResponse` model is being emitted but not actually referenced, that does sound like a bug \\\\u2014 we shouldn't be generating unused models. Especially in cases like this where you're doing a long-running POST action and the 200 response is effectively empty, it\\\\u2019s more accurate to model the operation with just a `202` and an error response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor your case, you can avoid using `OkResponse` entirely by switching to `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync` or passing `never` as the third argument. That will prevent the generation of the unnecessary `OkResponse` model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, keep in mind that for LROs, the POST operation typically doesn't return 200 anyway. That response is just a placeholder in the old pattern to signal \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"void\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". If you're converting from existing Swagger, and it doesn\\\\u2019t actually return 200, you should be able to safely drop that response from the Swagger and avoid the breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, if you do need to customize the final response for the LRO, `getLroResponse` can be used to override the response returned at the end of the operation \\\\u2014 no need to rely on `OkResponse` at all.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n# TSP Install fails with below error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## question \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am trying to install TSP and its dependencies and it fails with below error.

For these scenarios, you can use the [`namespace` configuration option](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/emitter/#namespace) in your `tspconfig.yaml` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you want the published SDK to follow closely with the package structure and namespaces in your TypeSpec file, you should also pass in the `package-name` flag with the desired value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Using the `namespace` Flag\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `namespace` option allows you to specify where the generated code should be placed within your package structure. This is particularly useful for cases where you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Keep generated code isolated in a dedicated subdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing SDK structures\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Separate generated code from hand-written code\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Example Configuration\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we will take you through emitting generated code into a specific subdirectory (like `_generated`), with the idea that you will be fully-wrapping the generated code.

The main issues stem from how block quotes, bullet lists, and indentation are rendered from TypeSpec doc comments into Python docstrings.\\\\n\\\\n**Recommended Actions:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Review and Update TypeSpec Doc Comments:**\\\\n   - Ensure that any block quotes, bullet lists, or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments follow [CommonMark markdown](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation) and avoid ambiguous indentation or missing blank lines.\\\\n   - For bullet lists, always add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure consistent indentation.\\\\n   - For block quotes, ensure a blank line after the block before any new section starts.\\\\n   - Avoid duplicate explicit target names (e.g., multiple links with the same label like \\\\\\\"learn more\\\\\\\").\\\\n\\\\n2. **Example Fixes:**\\\\n   - If you have a doc comment like:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * This is a summary.\\\\n      * - item one\\\\n      * - item two\\\\n      * More details.\\\\n      */\\\\n     ```\\\\n     Update it to:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * This is a summary.\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - item one\\\\n      * - item two\\\\n      *\\\\n      * More details.\\\\n      */\\\\n     ```\\\\n   - For block quotes, ensure:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * > This is a block quote.\\\\n      *\\\\n      * Next paragraph.\\\\n      */\\\\n     ```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Check for Indentation Issues:**\\\\n   - Sphinx expects consistent indentation in docstrings. If your TypeSpec doc comments have inconsistent indentation, fix them so that all lines align properly.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Union Types and Enum Documentation:**\\\\n   - For unions like `ServiceTier`, if you want to document the options, use a doc comment above the union and format the list with blank lines:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * Service tier options:\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - auto\\\\n      * - default\\\\n      * - flex\\\\n      * - scale\\\\n      * - priority\\\\n      */\\\\n     union ServiceTier {\\\\n       \\\\\\\"auto\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"flex\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"scale\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"priority\\\\\\\",\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n\\\\n5. **General Style:**\\\\n   - Follow the [TypeSpec style guide](https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide) for comment and block formatting.\\\\n   - Use the built-in TypeSpec formatter to ensure consistent output.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Regenerate and Validate:**\\\\n   - After updating your TypeSpec files, re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python SDK docs. The Sphinx warnings/errors should be resolved if the doc comments are properly formatted.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\nThe errors are caused by markdown formatting in TypeSpec doc comments that do not translate cleanly to Sphinx/reStructuredText. By ensuring blank lines around lists and block quotes, avoiding duplicate link targets, and maintaining consistent indentation, you can eliminate these warnings and errors in your Python SDK documentation build.\\\\n\\\\nIf you continue to see issues, review the generated Python docstrings directly and compare them to Sphinx's [supported docstring formats](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md) for further adjustments.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\\\\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\\\\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\\\\nHere are practical steps:\\\\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\\\\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\\\\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\\\\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\\\\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\\\\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\\\\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nsphinx = false\\\\n```\\\"}\"}]",
