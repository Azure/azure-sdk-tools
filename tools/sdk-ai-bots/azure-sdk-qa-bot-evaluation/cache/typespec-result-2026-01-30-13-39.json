            "answer": "To make an interface internal so that it does not appear in the public interface of the generated Python SDK, you should use the `@access(Access.internal, \"python\")` decorator from the Azure.ClientGenerator.Core library on the interface itself. However, simply marking the interface or its operations as internal is not sufficient if any public operation references the interface or its models, as access is propagated from usage.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n- Apply `@access(Access.internal, \"python\")` to the interface you want to hide.\n- Ensure that none of its operations or models are referenced by any public operations or models. If any public operation references them, those types will be promoted to public regardless of the decorator.\n\nExample:\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\";\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\n\n@access(Access.internal, \"python\")\ninterface EvaluationResultsOperations {\n  @access(Access.internal, \"python\")\n  op getEvaluationResults(): EvaluationResult;\n}\n\n@access(Access.internal, \"python\")\nmodel EvaluationResult {\n  value: string;\n}\n```\n\nIf you do this and ensure that `EvaluationResultsOperations` and its models are not referenced by any public operations, they will not appear in the public Python SDK client.\n\nIf you still see the interface in the public client, double-check that no public operation or model references it, directly or indirectly. Access is propagated, so any public usage will override the internal marking.\n\nThere is no supported way to generate the interface but keep it hidden from the public client if it is referenced by public operations/models. The suppression or patching approach is not recommended and not supported by TypeSpec best practices.",

I tried adding `@access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` to those classes, but it didn\\\\u2019t work. Using `@removed` does remove the classes, but it removes them for all language SDKs, which isn\\\\u2019t what we want. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there a recommended approach to exclude certain classes from generation only in the Python SDK? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to remove specific classes only from the Python SDK in TypeSpec, using @access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") won\\\\u2019t work if the model is referenced by a public operation. To hide the model, you must also apply the decorator to the related operation that uses it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn your case, the operation analyzeConversations uses the base type AnalyzeConversationTask, and the model you want to remove\\\\u2014LuisParameters\\\\u2014is a subtype of AnalysisParameters, which is used by ConversationTaskParameters. Since LuisParameters is part of a discriminated model (TargetIntentResult), it cannot be hidden from the wire-level API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the Python SDK board has recommended removing these types and you agree, then yes\\\\u2014adding @removed(version) is the only way to exclude them across all SDKs. Since the C# SDK has already shipped with these types, you could remove them in a C# patch release or the next planned release. This approach is acceptable for Python, but you need to confirm with the .NET team.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, it\\\\u2019s not possible to remove exported classes using _patch.py customization in the Python SDK.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_http_specs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"readme.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"HTTP Test scenarios\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/packages/http-specs/specs/readme.tsp\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# HTTP Test scenarios\\\\\\\\n# readme.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# HTTP Test scenarios\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**_Pending_**\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_rest_api_specs_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"SDK-Breaking-Changes.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/SDK-Breaking-Changes\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"| Short Link: | [aka.ms/azsdk/sdk-suppression](https://aka.ms/azsdk/sdk-suppression) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|--|--|\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_migration_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec-migration-docs-2025-07-17.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Missing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externalDocs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Missing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externalDocs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec-migration-docs-2025-07-17.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Missing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externalDocs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```diff\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"put\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"operationId\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"SavingsPlanOrderAlias_Create\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n-    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externalDocs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n-        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2215851/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n-    },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"parameters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdd above the corresponding operation: @OpenAPI.externalDocs(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2215851/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_rest_api_specs_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"SDK-Breaking-Changes.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Table of Contents\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/SDK-Breaking-Changes\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Table of Contents\\\\\\\\n## How Does the Suppression Work\\\\\\\\n# SDK-Breaking-Changes.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Table of Contents\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## How Does the Suppression Work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe suppression file will remain with the specification move with it to other branches or repositories(such as from the private specification repository to the public specification repository).

`readme.md`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Enable SDK generation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e[!IMPORTANT]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e You cannot enable SDK generation for both TypeSpec and OpenAPI

Disable one before enabling the other.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### [TypeSpec](#tab/typespec)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdd the specific SDK language emitter settings to `tspconfig.yaml`. For example, to generate CSharp SDK code from your TypeSpecs:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Add `@azure-typespec/http-client-csharp-mgmt` to the `options` settings in `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Refer to the 'ContosoWidgetManager' samples to set the default values for each SDK language emitter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - For management plane TypeSpecs, refer to [Contoso.Management tspconfig.yaml](https://aka.ms/azsdk/tspconfig-sample-mpg).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - For data plane TypeSpecs, refer to [Contoso.WidgetManager tspconfig.yaml](https://aka.ms/azsdk/tspconfig-sample-dpg).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-typespec/http-client-csharp-mgmt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    namespace: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Azure.ResourceManager.Contoso\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    emitter-output-dir: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{output-dir}/{service-dir}/{namespace}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### [OpenAPI](#tab/openapi)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigure the `swagger-to-sdk` section in `readme.md`.

This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `POST` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read`: The property is visible when the resource is read. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  returned in an HTTP `GET` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update`: The property is visible when the resource is updated. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `PATCH` or `PUT` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete`: The property is visible when a resource is deleted. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `DELETE` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query`: The property is visible when a resource is passed as a parameter in a query. This visibility is checked, for\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  example, when a property is a parameter in an HTTP `GET` operation (**this should not be confused with an HTTP query\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameter defined using `@query`**).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Lifecycle visibility transforms\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can explicitly compute the shape of a model within a _specific_ lifecycle phase by using the four built-in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntemplates for lifecycle transforms:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Create\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Create` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Read` lifecycle phase,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Update` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, with the types of the properties set to `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have _either_ the `Create` or `Update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  visibility modifiers enabled, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Delete` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Query` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Update)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ReadExample is Read\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateExample is Create\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel UpdateExample is Update\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateOrUpdateExample is CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you use these templates, the resulting models have no `Lifecycle` visibility modifiers applied, so that any\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemitters or libraries that use lifecycle visibility will not alter them further.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#typespec-client-generator-core#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Decorators\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ClientGenerator.Core\\\\\\\\n### `@access` {#@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.access}\\\\\\\\n# libraries#typespec-client-generator-core#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ClientGenerator.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@access` {#@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.access}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| value | `EnumMember`     | The access info you want to set for this model or operation.
