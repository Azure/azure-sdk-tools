.SYNOPSIS 
Publishes a standalone dotnet executable to an artifact staging directory.

.DESCRIPTION
Assembles a standalone executable and places it within the given staging directory. This script takes care of any additional minutae that is required to
enable a usable binary down the line after signing or notarization.

.PARAMETER Rid
The target platform. Takes the form of "osx-x64", "win-arm64", "linux-x64", etc. A full list is available here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog

.PARAMETER ArtifactStagingDirectory
The root directory which will receive the compressed standalone executable. 

.PARAMETER Target 
The targeted folder that should be built and assembled into a standalone executable.

.PARAMETER Framework
The targeted .NET framework. Defaults to "net6.0."
