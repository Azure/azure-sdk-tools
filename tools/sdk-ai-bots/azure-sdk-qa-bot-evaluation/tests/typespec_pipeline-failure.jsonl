There is no strict requirement in the referenced documentation that all resource providers (including ring 0 services like Microsoft.Compute) must have their specs present in RPaaSMaster if they have received an explicit exemption from RPaaS onboarding. The documentation and FAQ state that if your service is not onboarded to RPaaS (and has an exception), you do not need to merge your specs into RPaaSMaster. The presence or absence of Microsoft.Compute in RPaaSMaster does not dictate requirements for other RPs; each spec owner is responsible for their own onboarding and branch sync according to their onboarding status and exemptions. If your ring 0 service has an approved exception, you can continue to manage your specs in 'main' and do not need to merge into RPaaSMaster unless instructed otherwise by the ARM or EngSys team.", "context": "", "response_length": 1006}
