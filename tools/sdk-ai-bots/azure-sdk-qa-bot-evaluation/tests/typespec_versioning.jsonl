However, TypeSpec currently does not support versioning decorators on decorator arguments (like changing the `@maxValue` parameter per version). Directly updating the decorator value would affect all versions.\nThe correct Azure-compliant pattern is:\nCreate a new property (with a different internal name) for the updated constraint.\nUse `@removed` and `@renamedFrom` on the old property, and `@added` on the new property, both on the same model. This allows you to apply different constraints in different API versions without affecting other versions or causing duplicate operation errors.\nIf the operation signature/model type is changed for only the new version, use the add/remove/rename pattern and use `@sharedRoute` on both versions of the operation (see linked examples). This avoids the duplicate operation error and ensures correct OpenAPI emission for each version.\nExample:\n```\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\n// Old property: max 30 days, removed in new version\n@maxValue(30)\n@removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview, \"validityPeriodInDays\")\nvalidityPeriodInDaysV1: int32;\n// New property: max 90 days, only in new version\n@added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n@maxValue(90)\nvalidityPeriodInDays: int32;\n}\n```\nIn your operation/interface, you may need to do the same if the operation signature changes. If you want to have different models for different versions but keep the same route, use the `@sharedRoute` decorator and the `@renamedFrom` pattern for the operation as well (see the \"Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\" example in the docs).\nThis pattern will:\nPrevent duplicate operation errors (since each operation/model is only present in one version)\nEmit the correct schema per version\nNot require changing the operation name at the API surface (the renaming is internal)\nSummary:\nUse the add/remove/rename pattern for versioned property changes that affect validation/constraints.\nUse `@sharedRoute` and `@renamedFrom` for operations if the operation signature changes with the model.\nDo NOT update decorator arguments directly for just one version—they affect all versions.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "Diagnostics", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/openapi3/diagnostics"}, {"title": "Proper Service Versioning", "link": ""}, {"title": "error duplicate-property in @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager/lib tsp", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "Duplicate model definition errors on compilation with TypeSpec Compiler v1.0.0 - Microsoft.Mission", "link": ""}, {"title": "TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?", "link": ""}, {"title": "TypeSpec", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff"}, {"title": "error duplicate-property in @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager/lib tsp", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "Diagnostics", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/extending-typespec/diagnostics"}, {"title": "Operations", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/http/operations"}, {"title": "Understanding the OpenAPI Changes", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/mustread"}, {"title": "Versioning", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning"}, {"title": "Error reported from common library with intersect-duplicate-property", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "Duplicate Body Error When Instantiating `ProxyResourceOperations`", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/arm-proxy-operations-error"}, {"title": "Versioning", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/10versioning"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/08-conclusion"}, {"title": "Versioning", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning"}, {"title": "non-breaking-versioning", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning"}, {"title": "Versioning", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning"}, {"title": "Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec-conversion"}, {"title": "Tutorial", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/guide"}, {"title": "Decorators", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/http/reference/decorators"}, {"title": "Need advice on how to change operation parameters on a breaking change", "link": ""}, {"title": "How can I change the operation template of an operation in newer versions", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/versioning_operation_template_changes"}, {"title": "Need advice on how to change operation parameters on a breaking change", "link": ""}, {"title": "Default value starting from a specific API version?", "link": ""}, {"title": "Breaking Change Policy", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/breaking-change-policy"}], "expected_references": [{"title": "How can I change the operation template of an operation in newer versions", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/versioning_operation_template_changes"}, {"title": "Versioning", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning"}, {"title": "Need advice on how to change operation parameters on a breaking change", "link": ""}]}

This means that if you update a pattern in your TypeSpec model, it will apply to all API versions emitted by TypeSpec, not just a new version. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid hidden inconsistencies between the declared API surface and the actual backend behavior.\nIf you need different validation patterns (such as a new regex for a resource name) for a specific API version and newer, you have two supported options in TypeSpec:\nIf the new pattern applies to all versions: Update the @pattern decorator in the model directly. This is the common and recommended path if your backend enforces the new pattern for all versions.\nIf the pattern truly differs by API version (rare, and usually discouraged): You must explicitly version the type. For example, you can introduce a new scalar type or model for the new version, and use the @typeChangedFrom or @renamedFrom decorators to describe the transition between versions. This approach requires you to manage versioning logic in TypeSpec, not in the generated OpenAPI/JSON files. You should not edit the generated files by hand, and manual changes to JSON files are not supported.\nHere's a sketch of the pattern versioning approach:\n```\n/** Legacy pattern type for old API versions */\n@pattern(\"^[a-z0-9]{3,18}$\")\nscalar ResourceNameLegacy extends string;\nmodel MyResource {\n@key(\"resourceName\")\n@typeChangedFrom(Versions.v2, ResourceNameLegacy)\n@pattern(\"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$\")\nname: string;\n}\n```\nIn this example, TypeSpec will emit the old pattern for older API versions and the new pattern for v2 and above, but you must structure your code accordingly. Note that this approach can lead to more complicated TypeSpec code and is only justified if your backend actually enforces different rules per API version.\nSummary: Do not manually edit JSON files generated by TypeSpec. Use versioning decorators and, if necessary, versioned types to achieve per-version differences. But for most cases, apply the new pattern universally if the service behavior matches.
