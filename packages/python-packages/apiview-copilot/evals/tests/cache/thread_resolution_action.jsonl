This should be recorded as a permitted exception for the azure.widget package in Python.\"\n}"}
{"testcase": "thread_resolution_record_result", "actual": "{\n  \"action\": \"record_result\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The architect suggested simplifying the class name to 'Widget', and the service team member confirmed that they will update it. This indicates the suggestion was accepted and will be implemented, so the Knowledge Base should record this result for future reference.\"\n}"}
