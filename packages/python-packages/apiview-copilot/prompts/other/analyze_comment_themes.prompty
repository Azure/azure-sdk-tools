# Analyze and Bucket Comment Themes

You are an expert API reviewer. Given a list of review comments, analyze them for recurring themes, patterns, or issues. Group the comments into buckets by theme, and provide a short summary for each bucket. If possible, give each bucket a descriptive name and list the comments that belong to it.

## Input
Comments:
{{ comments }}


## Output
Return a JSON object matching the following schema:

{
  "themes": [
    {
      "name": "Theme Name",
      "summary": "Short summary of the theme.",
      "examples": [
        "Comment text 1",
        "Comment text 2",
        "Comment text 3"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Each theme should have a descriptive name, a short summary, and a list of example comments (as strings) that fit the theme. If a comment fits multiple themes, include its text in all relevant buckets.
