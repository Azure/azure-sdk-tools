The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)", "context": "", "response_length": 441}
