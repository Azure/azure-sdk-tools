{"testcase": "Playground usage", "query": "title: Playground usage\n\nquestion: Hi,\nQuestion on usage of the playground at https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground . When we are putting together something to use as an example for a new addition of a child proxy resource to our spec we get import errors. This is because we are importing from a common model files.\nIs it possible to add files or somehow scope a playground so its context is our existing specification so it imports the references correctly.  For example our spec is in \\specification\\netapp\\resource-manager\\Microsoft.NetApp\\NetApp that includes models.tsp file.\nCan we create a playground that would resolve something like import \"./../models.tsp\";", "ground_truth": "There is no a 'remote import' feature in the typespec azure playground.", "context": "", "response_length": 71}
{"testcase": "What decorator should be used in this case?", "query": "title: What decorator should be used in this case?\n\nquestion: Hi team,\nIn version v2, we introduced a new model model2 and updated featureA (originally added in v1) to use model2 as its parameter. In v1, featureA used model1 at the same position.\nHere’s the setup I tried (using @typeChangedFrom):\n```\n@added(v1)\nmodel1;\n@added(v2)\nmodel2;\n@added(v1)\nfeatureA {\n@typeChangedFrom(v1, model1)\nbody: model2;\n}\n```\nHowever, this shows the error: \"model2 does not exist in v1\".\nWhat would be the correct decorator to use in this situation?\nThank you!", "ground_truth": "it should be `typedChangedFrom(v2, model1)` here otherwise you are saying in v1 you changed from using model1 to model2 which then of course doesn't exists", "context": "", "response_length": 155}
{"testcase": "Hi team, could someone please help grant me permission to view the workflow for my Azure REST API PR?", "query": "title: Hi team, could someone please help grant me permission to view the workflow for my Azure REST API PR?\n\nquestion: Right now, after pushing my commit, I’m unable to see the error details for the validation checks, it just says “at least one review required to see the workflow.” This makes it difficult to verify if my changes are passing validation before the final review.\nWould it be possible to enable workflow visibility for me so I can debug and ensure everything is in order ahead of time?
