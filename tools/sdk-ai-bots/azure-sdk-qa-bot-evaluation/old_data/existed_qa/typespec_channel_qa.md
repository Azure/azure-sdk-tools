## Why are semantic validations complaining about missing swagger, info, paths in TypeSpec resources.json file?

The resources.json file is a middle output generated during the conversion process from Swagger to TypeSpec. It is not part of the final TypeSpec and can be safely removed after the conversion is complete. This file contains the operations and is produced as an intermediate step in the migration process.

## Why are examples not getting linked via "x-ms-example" on compilation?

The reason examples are not getting linked via "x-ms-example" on compilation is due to the operation ID not following the correct naming convention. The operation ID should be in the format "ResourceNameInPlural_Verb", such as "SignupRequests_Create" instead of "SignupRequest_Create".

## Why are semantic validations complaining about missing swagger, info, paths in TypeSpec resources.json file?

Semantic validations might be complaining about missing 'swagger', 'info', and 'paths' in the TypeSpec resources.json file because these are essential components required for a valid OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification. The 'swagger' or 'openapi' field specifies the version of the OpenAPI specification being used. The 'info' section provides metadata about the API, such as its title and version. The 'paths' section describes the endpoints of the API and their operations. If these components are missing, the file does not conform to the OpenAPI specification standards, leading to validation errors.

## Why is the code-gen securityDefinitions using AadOauth2Auth violating the swagger lintDiff rules requirement?

The code-gen securityDefinitions using AadOauth2Auth is violating the swagger lintDiff rules requirement because it does not adhere to the required structure for security definitions in OpenAPI (swagger) specifications. Specifically, the `type`, `authorizationUrl`, `flow`, `description`, and `scopes` must match a certain format and content. To fix the error, one could adjust the OAuth2 definition to match the required `azure_auth` structure, including the correct `type`, `authorizationUrl`, `flow`, `description`, and `scopes` as specified in the guidelines.

## Why is the command 'npx tsv specification/voiceservices/VoiceServices.Management' now giving an error when it was working fine before?

The command 'npx tsv specification/voiceservices/VoiceServices.Management' may be giving an error due to several reasons: missing documentation for enum members, changes in the `voiceservices.json` file that could be considered a breaking change, and the use of enums that are not marked with `@fixed`, which is now required as enums have become FIXED to prevent breaking changes. It's suggested to add documentation for clarity, ensure enums are correctly marked, and restart the Visual Studio or the TypeSpec VSCode extension if updates have been made. Additionally, the error might be related to deprecated packages or the need to migrate or suppress linter rules due to updates in best practices. It's also important to check for any pop-up notifications about failures when restarting services or extensions.

## What configs are needed to add sdk-for-go support?

To add support for the SDK-for-Go, ensure that 'azure-sdk-for-go' is included in the 'tspconfig.yaml' file and address any issues of duplication in schema definitions by modifying the 'TypeSpec'.

## Why did the pipeline fail due to an inability to import '@azure-tools/typespec-providerhub'?

The pipeline failed due to an inability to import '@azure-tools/typespec-providerhub' because the package has been deprecated. The latest versions of typespec-providerhub-controller no longer require typespec-providerhub. The package was primarily providing validation, which has now been moved to the standard Azure core ruleset and a new 'canonical' ruleset in Azure core. To resolve the issue, it is necessary to remove the import of '@azure-tools/typespec-providerhub' from the specification and ensure that any dependencies are updated accordingly.

## Does typespec-providerhub-controller need to be updated to be compatible with typespec-autorest@0.41.0?

The typespec-providerhub-controller needed an update for compatibility with typespec-autorest@0.41.0, which was addressed in version 0.41.1. Although the provider hub controller package release tends to be delayed, there are plans to open the dependency range to prevent similar issues in the future, provided there are no major breaking changes.

## How can we introduce ApiVersion=B into our flow while continuing to produce OpenAPI spec, contracts, and client DLLs for both the new ApiVersion=B and all prior versions?

To introduce ApiVersion=B while continuing to produce OpenAPI spec, contracts, and client DLLs for both the new version and all prior versions, it's recommended to utilize the TypeSpec versioning library. This approach allows for the management of multiple API versions within the same project, generating separate Swagger files for each version. Documentation and examples on versioning can be found in the TypeSpec Azure documentation and the azure-rest-api-specs GitHub repository.

## Should we introduce a completely isolated TSP project with its own main.tsp and spec.tsp file for ApiVersion=B?

Introducing a completely isolated TSP project with its own main.tsp and spec.tsp file for ApiVersion=B is not necessary. Instead, leveraging the TypeSpec versioning library to manage multiple API versions within the same project is a more efficient approach.

## Is it better to incorporate two versions of the resource provider within the same project using one main.tsp, versionA.tsp, and versionB.tsp?

It is better to incorporate two versions of the resource provider within the same project using one main.tsp, versionA.tsp, and versionB.tsp. This method is supported by the TypeSpec versioning library, which allows for efficient management of multiple API versions.

## What are the pros, cons, and potential issues of each approach for managing multiple API versions?

The approach of managing multiple API versions within the same project using the TypeSpec versioning library has several advantages, including the ability to generate separate Swagger files for each version and maintain a unified codebase. However, it requires careful management of versioned resources and understanding of the versioning library's capabilities. Potential issues include the complexity of handling API deltas and ensuring compatibility across versions.

## Why is the TypeSpec Validation failing for my PR?

The TypeSpec Validation might be failing due to the use of enums, which in the latest version should be converted to open unions. A codefix available in the VSCode or VS extension for TypeSpec can automatically convert enums into open unions. Additionally, ensuring that TypeSpec files are placed in the correct directory, as per the guidelines, can help resolve the issue.

## How can I fix the error that limits TypeSpec folder depth to 3 levels or less?

To fix the error that limits TypeSpec folder depth to 3 levels or less, ensure that TypeSpec files are placed in the correct directory according to the folder structure guidelines, specifically in specifications/<YourRP>/Management.

## What am I missing in following the folder structure like other RPs in the repo?

Following the folder structure like other RPs in the repo requires placing TypeSpec files in the correct directory, specifically in specifications/<YourRP>/Management, as outlined in the folder structure guidelines.

## How can I auto-create a Swagger definition from TypeSpec?

To auto-create a Swagger definition from TypeSpec, configure the typespec-autorest emitter to emit Swagger in accordance with the azure-rest-api-specs repository requirements. Detailed instructions can be found in the azure-rest-api-specs documentation on GitHub.

## Why does running npx tsv in the private repo fail with an error about using the enum keyword?

Running npx tsv in the private repo fails with an error about using the enum keyword because the current tooling does not handle enums well as union variants. The recommended approach is to convert enums to unions to ensure compatibility.

## Does the general documentation for Azure's TypeSpec mention anything against using enums?

The general documentation for Azure's TypeSpec does not explicitly mention anything against using enums. However, there is an ongoing migration to support enums as unions to accommodate both Azure and non-Azure customers, suggesting a preference for using unions over enums.

## Can the API version be placed inside the @server section of TypeSpec to remain in x-ms-parameterized-host?

No, the API version cannot be placed inside the @server section of TypeSpec to remain in x-ms-parameterized-host without causing issues. Moving the API version from x-ms-parameterized-host to paths is necessary when migrating from Swagger to TypeSpec, as this change is recognized by the breaking changes tool. However, this migration may lead to breaking change issues for every path, which ideally should be verified by tools rather than manual checking.

## Is there a way to exclude the API version in parameters of operations?

Excluding the API version in parameters of operations directly is not straightforward. While there is a method to override the API version parameter using traits in TypeSpec, this approach might not be fully suitable for all services, especially brownfield services. Additionally, placing the API version in the @server section could result in the API version appearing twice, which is not desirable. Therefore, a clear method to exclude the API version from operation parameters without causing duplication or visibility issues has not been identified.

## How can I exclude some TypeSpec part from the validation?

To exclude some TypeSpec parts from validation, you cannot directly suppress the 'TypeSpec Validation' itself. However, you can address specific TypeSpec Linter errors by either fixing them or using suppression mechanisms for the sub-checks like 'TypeSpec Linter'. Documentation on how to suppress violations in source is available, and for certain cases, it might be possible to exclude specific versions from validation. It's crucial to ensure that public-facing APIs and internal APIs are kept consistent without exposing internal APIs unnecessarily. Tools and mechanisms are available for deriving internal API specifications from public-facing APIs, ensuring a single source of truth.

## What is causing the discrepancy between the local and pipeline TypeSpec Validation results?

The discrepancy between the local and pipeline TypeSpec Validation results may be caused by outdated dependencies. Running `npm ci` to update dependencies and ensuring you are up to date with the main branch can fix the issue.

## Why does the final operation name to SDK emitter remain 'reclassify' instead of changing to 'reclassifyJob'?

The final operation name remains 'reclassify' instead of changing to 'reclassifyJob' possibly due to the ResourceAction taking the operation name as the action part in the URL when there is no override. Autorest respects @clientName for ARM transition, and it's intended for autorest to render it as a client. However, moving @clientName from routes.tsp to client.tsp showed differences in the tsp verification step, indicating that 'operationId' actually takes the @clientName in TCGC, suggesting that decorators in TCGC might affect Swagger.

## Does this issue of operation names not changing affect all SDKs?

Yes, this issue of operation names not changing can affect all SDKs, especially considering that Autorest respects @clientName for the ARM transition, and it's a general behavior intended for Autorest to render it as a client.

## Is the proposed solution to open a PR to change the operation name in client.tsp to 'reclassifyJob'?

The proposed solution to open a PR to change the operation name in client.tsp to 'reclassifyJob' is correct, but it was decided not to move the @clientName to avoid Swagger changes. This indicates that while changing the operation name in client.tsp to 'reclassifyJob' is a proposed solution, it may not be pursued to prevent affecting Swagger.

## Why did the AVM team prefer to avoid developing their own language interpreter?

The AVM team preferred to avoid developing their own language interpreter, suggesting a preference for leveraging existing tools and avoiding the complexities of language interpretation.

## Is it possible to have a nullable primitive (e.g., Guid?) but also required in the spec at the same time?

It is possible to have a nullable primitive (e.g., Guid?) and also mark it as required in the specification. This approach allows a field to be explicitly marked as required, meaning some value must be supplied upon creation, which could be null. This method is useful for scenarios like patch request bodies where fields are optional but still need to be explicitly provided, even if null. However, this concept may conflict with the generation of C# models, where the need to mark a nullable value type as required can seem contradictory but serves specific use cases, such as ensuring a property is always sent over the wire, regardless of it being null or having a UUID value.

## How can I replace the knownValues with a named union in my PR, and will this change affect the generated swagger?

To replace the knownValues with a named union in your PR, use the pattern of defining a union type with specific variants and a string type to mark it as extensible. This approach should not cause a breaking change in the generated swagger. However, if it does introduce a breaking change, you may need assistance with getting the changes approved.

## Is it possible to replace the value inside the CSPROJ with a key in tspconfig.yaml?

Yes, it is possible to replace the value inside the CSPROJ with a key in tspconfig.yaml by using the `arm-types-dir` as an autorest option.

## What is the equivalent of the current implementation with @encodedName, considering the error 'Invalid mime type 'csharp'?

The equivalent of the current implementation with @encodedName, considering the error 'Invalid mime type 'csharp'', is to use the @clientName decorator for SDK renames as specified in the TypeSpec Azure documentation.

## Is there any way to bypass TypeSpec validation checks for a specific PR?

To bypass TypeSpec validation checks for a specific PR, spec owners are responsible for either fixing or suppressing these issues in their next PR to their spec. Additionally, for detailed guidance on specific errors, one can search the main for specs similar to theirs that might already be fixed, or consult the TypeSpec Azure documentation and use the TypeSpec extension for VSCode or VS for inline violations and automated codefixes.

## Is the change in property behavior from version 0.40 to 0.41 a bug or a feature?

The change in property behavior from version 0.40 to 0.41 is by design, not a bug. It was decided that the original change wasn't suitable for the spec repository.

## Can someone help in fixing the update scenario issue in CLI that broke after migrating our swagger to use the TypeSpec spec?

To fix the update scenario issue in CLI that broke after migrating your swagger to use the TypeSpec spec, you need to add an `@OpenAPI.extension` decorator with the settings `"x-ms-mutability": ["create", "update", "read"]` for each of your resources that are affected. This change is necessary for both ProxyResource and TrackedResource types, and any resources using these templates. This adjustment addresses the visibility and mutability of properties in the ARM resource templates, ensuring they are correctly marked for create, update, and read operations. If your service is an RPaaS service and you're encountering issues with CLI updates, this solution should help rectify the problem by ensuring the properties bag is visible and mutable as required. Additionally, ensure all properties marked for creation are also marked for update to maintain consistency in PUT calls for both creation and update operations.

## Should TypeSpec generate the C# property as a Guid instead of a string when marked with @format('uuid')?

Yes, TypeSpec should generate the C# property as a Guid instead of a string when marked with @format('uuid'). This translation from uuid to Guid in C# is considered a valuable contribution and should be implemented. However, it's important to also include validation for any type marked with @format(uuid) to ensure it is a valid Guid. The use of Guids, especially in Azure Resource Manager (ARM) specifications, is subject to approval on a case-by-case basis due to concerns about their construction and serialization/deserialization. If Guids are absolutely required, approval from the Azure API review board is necessary.

## What is the correct way to mark an enum with modelAsString: false?

To mark an enum with modelAsString: false, currently, you should use the @fixed decorator and suppress any warnings. However, this approach is in the process of being deprecated. In the future, enums will be automatically treated as fixed, and for extensible enums, a union with a string variant should be used instead. This change will be enforced starting from next week.

## Should the @fixed decorator be used and the warning suppressed, or is there another method?

Yes, the @fixed decorator should be used and the warning suppressed for now. However, this method is being phased out. In the future, enums will automatically be considered fixed, and for extensible enums, it is recommended to use a union with a string variant.

## How should enums with modelAsString attributes be described in a new API version using TypeSpec?

Enums with modelAsString attributes in a new API version using TypeSpec should be described using the @fixed decorator for now, with the warning suppressed. This approach is temporary, as the process is moving towards automatically treating enums as fixed. For extensible enums, a union with a string variant should be utilized. This change will be enforced in the near future.

## How do I resolve the compilation errors in routes.tsp when generating the dotnet SDK?

To resolve compilation errors in routes.tsp when generating the dotnet SDK, you should use the @pollingOperation decorator to specify which operation can be used to check the status of the Long Running Operation (LRO). Additionally, ensure that your TypeSpec is correctly updated to reflect any changes in the operation signatures or response handling, particularly for operations with a 202 response code, which must specify `x-ms-long-running-operation: true`. For defining custom LRO patterns in TypeSpec, refer to the documentation and examples provided in the Azure/cadl-ranch repository on GitHub. If you encounter issues with LroExtension rules or need further guidance on updating your TypeSpec, consider reviewing examples of services that have handled a 202 response code or seeking assistance from the community or specific contributors mentioned.

## Should we share the data model of FaceList between request and response, and set default RecognitionModel to Reco01?

Yes, separate model definitions for request and response should be used to accurately reflect the actual behavior. This is because setting a default value for a property indicates a service default, which does not necessarily impact its presence in a response. Additionally, to prevent roundtripping results when 'returnRecognitionModel' is false, it's advisable to have two different models and possibly model this as two separate logical operations with a shared route.

## How do I pass the enum value as a string in Typespec?

To pass an enum value as a string in Typespec, you should use a union instead of an enum, as enums are not assignable to strings within the Typespec type system.

## Which decorator should be used for properties that are required for creation but cannot be updated after that?

Use the `@createOnly` decorator for properties that are required for creation but cannot be updated afterwards.
