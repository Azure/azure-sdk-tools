response:
  action: no_action
  reasoning: |
    The architect (tjprescott) initially suggests simplifying the name, but the service team (noodle) provides a valid justification for keeping it as is,
    citing established patterns and the specific purpose of the class. The architect then acknowledges this explanation and agrees with the decision.
    Since there is mutual agreement and no further action is needed, the appropriate response is 'no_action'.
