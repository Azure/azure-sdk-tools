# CODEOWNERS with no errors, for match testing.
# The purpose of this file is for end-to-end GetMatchingCodeownersEntry with targeted subdirectory and fallback.
# The examples in here are real world. For example, many sdk service directories have azure resourcemanager 
# library subdirectories and the following glob pattern, /sdk/**/azure-resourcemanager-*/, is used to get just
# these directories while leaving the base sdk service directory ownership alone.

# Fallback
/** @TestTeam1

# PRLabel: %TestLabel1
/sdk/ServiceDirectory1/ @TestOwner2 @TestTeam1

# PRLabel: %TestLabel2
# ServiceLabel: %TestLabel3
# AzureSdkOwners: @TestOwner4
/sdk/ServiceDirectory2/ @TestOwner3 @TestTeam2

# This entry needs to be after the previous entries otherwise, by github rules, they'll take
# ownership. With this entry, anything in an azure-service1-* subdirectory of the previous two
# service directory entires will belong to these owners and have these labels
# PRLabel: %TestLabel4
# ServiceLabel: %TestLabel2
/sdk/**/azure-service1-*/ @TestTeam4 @TestOwner0

# This owner owns everything log related in the repository
# PRLabel: %TestLabel3
