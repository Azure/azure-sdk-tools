            "comment": "Here is a summary of the service described by this APIView:\n\nAPI Purpose  \nThis API provides UI components and chat functionality for Azure Communication Chat on Android. It offers mechanisms to manage chat sessions, handle errors during chat interactions, and present chat threads via a dedicated view.\n\nAPI Version  \nThe Maven artifact is specified with version 1.0.0-beta.3, which represents the current version of this service.\n\nClient Classes  \nNo classes matching the *Client naming pattern are defined in this API.\n\nOther Key Classes and Their Methods  \nThe API exposes a `ChatAdapter` class that offers methods including `addOnErrorEventHandler`, `connect`, `disconnect`, and `removeOnErrorEventHandler`. Complementing this is the `ChatAdapterBuilder` class, which provides methods such as `credential`, `displayName`, `endpoint`, `identity`, `threadId`, and `build` to configure and instantiate the adapter. The `ChatCompositeEventHandler` interface declares a single method named `handle` to process events.\n\nAdditional supporting classes include models for error handling: `ChatCompositeErrorCode` (defining constants like JOIN_FAILED and SEND_MESSAGE_FAILED), `ChatCompositeErrorEvent` (with methods `getCause`, `getErrorCode`, and `getThreadId`), and `ChatCompositeException` for encapsulating chat-related errors. The presentation layer is represented by the `ChatThreadView` class, which offers several constructors to integrate the chat UI component into Android layouts.\n\nDependencies and Structure  \nThe API is packaged as a Maven artifact with compile-time dependencies on Azure Communication Chat, Azure Communication Common, and Kotlin libraries, and runtime dependencies on AndroidX components, Microsoft Fluent UI, and Jetpack Compose libraries. The design separates chat connectivity, error management, and UI presentation to facilitate integration into Android applications.",
