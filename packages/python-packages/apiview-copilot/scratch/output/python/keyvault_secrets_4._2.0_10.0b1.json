            "comment": "Here is a summary of the changes in this APIView:\n\n• The `azure.keyvault.secrets.ApiVersion` enum now includes additional values, with the newest API version being `7.6-preview.2`.\n\n• In the `DeletedSecret` class, the properties `deleted_date`, `id`, `name`, `recovery_id`, and `scheduled_purge_date` have been updated to use `Optional` types.\n\n• In the `KeyVaultSecret` class, the `id`, `name`, and `value` properties are now marked as `Optional`, and the initializer has been updated with explicit type hints for `properties` (of type `SecretProperties`) and `value` (of type `Optional[str]`).\n\n• A new class, `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier`, has been introduced. It includes read-only properties `name`, `source_id`, `vault_url`, and an optional `version`, and provides an initializer that accepts a `source_id` parameter.\n\n• The `SecretClient` class has several updates:\n – Its constructor now requires `credential` to be of type `TokenCredential` and accepts an `api_version` parameter that can be either an `ApiVersion` or a `str`. A new parameter, `verify_challenge_resource`, has also been added.\n – Methods such as `backup_secret`, `get_deleted_secret`, `get_secret`, `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, `list_properties_of_secrets`, `purge_deleted_secret`, `restore_secret_backup`, `set_secret`, and `update_secret_properties` now include explicit type hints for `**kwargs` (typed as `Any`) and other parameters. Notably, `begin_delete_secret` and `begin_recover_deleted_secret` now return `LROPoller` types, wrapping their respective result types.\n – A new method, `send_request`, has been added. It accepts an `HttpRequest`, a `stream` flag, and additional keyword arguments, and returns an `HttpResponse`.\n\n• The `SecretProperties` class now marks most of its properties (including `content_type`, `created_on`, `enabled`, `expires_on`, `id`, `key_id`, `name`, `not_before`, `recovery_level`, `tags`, `updated_on`, `vault_url`, and `version`) as `Optional`. A new property, `managed`, is also added, and the initializer has been modified to accept variadic arguments with proper type hints.\n\n• In the asynchronous namespace (`azure.keyvault.secrets.aio`), the `SecretClient` class mirrors many of these updates:\n – The constructor now also accepts an `api_version` of type `Union[ApiVersion, str]` along with the additional `verify_challenge_resource` parameter.\n – Listing methods (`list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, and `list_properties_of_secrets`) now return `AsyncItemPaged` types instead of `AsyncIterable`.\n – A new asynchronous method, `send_request`, has been added, which takes an `HttpRequest` (with similar parameters as its synchronous counterpart) and returns an `Awaitable[AsyncHttpResponse]`.\n – Other methods such as `set_secret` and `update_secret_properties` have updated their parameter type hints (for example, changing `tags` to an `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`).\n\nOverall, the diff significantly enhances type annotations (emphasizing the use of `Optional` and precise types for keyword arguments) and introduces new functionality for sending custom requests in both synchronous and asynchronous clients.",
