            "answer": "To make an interface internal in TypeSpec so that it does not appear in the public interface of the generated Python SDK, you should use the `@access(Access.internal)` decorator from `@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core` on the interface itself. However, for the decorator to be effective, all operations within the interface must also be marked as internal, either explicitly or by inheriting the interface's access level. \n\nHere is the recommended approach:\n\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\";\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\n\n@access(Access.internal)\ninterface EvaluationResultsOperations {\n  @access(Access.internal)\n  getResults(): EvaluationResult;\n  @access(Access.internal)\n  listResults(): EvaluationResult[];\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that both the interface and its operations are internal, and they will not appear in the public interface of the generated SDKs, including Python. The access info is propagated from the interface to its operations and models, so if any operation is public, the interface will be public as well. If all operations are internal and the interface is internal, it will be hidden from the public SDK surface.\n\nIf you want this to apply only to Python, you can use the `scope` parameter:\n\n```typespec\n@access(Access.internal, \"python\")\ninterface EvaluationResultsOperations {\n  @access(Access.internal, \"python\")\n  getResults(): EvaluationResult;\n  @access(Access.internal, \"python\")\n  listResults(): EvaluationResult[];\n}\n```\n\nNote: If any operation under the interface is public, the interface will be exposed. Also, if the interface is referenced by a public operation or model, it will be exposed. Make sure there are no public references to the interface or its operations.\n\nIf you have already tried this and it did not work, double-check that there are no public references to the interface or its operations elsewhere in your TypeSpec code. The propagation rules require all usages to be internal for the interface to be hidden.",

This is the interface which emits `EvaluationResultsOperations` which shows up on client. I would like to generate it but keep it hidden from public interface.\\\\nI tried following:\\\\n1. Mark all operations under it internal\\\\n2. Adding @access decorator to interface but that fails.\\\\nIs there a way to achieve it ?\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"To make an interface internal in TypeSpec so that it does not appear in the public interface of the generated Python SDK, you should use the `@access(Access.internal)` decorator from `@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core` on the interface itself. However, for the decorator to be effective, all operations within the interface must also be marked as internal, either explicitly or by inheriting the interface's access level. \\\\n\\\\nHere is the recommended approach:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nimport \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\\\\\\\";\\\\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\\\\n\\\\n@access(Access.internal)\\\\ninterface EvaluationResultsOperations {\\\\n  @access(Access.internal)\\\\n  getResults(): EvaluationResult;\\\\n  @access(Access.internal)\\\\n  listResults(): EvaluationResult[];\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will ensure that both the interface and its operations are internal, and they will not appear in the public interface of the generated SDKs, including Python. The access info is propagated from the interface to its operations and models, so if any operation is public, the interface will be public as well. If all operations are internal and the interface is internal, it will be hidden from the public SDK surface.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want this to apply only to Python, you can use the `scope` parameter:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\")\\\\ninterface EvaluationResultsOperations {\\\\n  @access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\")\\\\n  getResults(): EvaluationResult;\\\\n  @access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\")\\\\n  listResults(): EvaluationResult[];\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNote: If any operation under the interface is public, the interface will be exposed. Also, if the interface is referenced by a public operation or model, it will be exposed. Make sure there are no public references to the interface or its operations.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have already tried this and it did not work, double-check that there are no public references to the interface or its operations elsewhere in your TypeSpec code. The propagation rules require all usages to be internal for the interface to be hidden.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"We do not support hiding an entire operation group directly. The recommended approach is to redefine your client in client.tsp to control which operations appear on the public client. When you do this properly, the default service clients and their Operations classes should not be emitted\\\\u2014as long as you remove all previously generated SDK output before regenerating. Or you can use _patch.py to customize the code.\\\"}\"}]",
