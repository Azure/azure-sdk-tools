# Java API Review Maven Plugin

Generates `api.md` and `api.metadata.yml` from a built Java sources JAR. The same artifact works as a Maven plugin or a standalone executable JAR.

## Standalone execution and API Review Hub

Use the main plugin JAR, not the sources or Javadoc JAR. It includes its runtime dependencies and needs only Java 8+:

```shell
java -jar api-review-maven-plugin-1.0.0-beta.1.jar --sources-jar azure-json-1.6.0-beta.1-sources.jar --package-relative-path sdk/serialization/azure-json --output-directory api-review
```

All three options are required. The sources JAR must use its `<artifact>-<version>-sources.jar` filename; rename a copy if the build uses a custom final name. Its Maven metadata supplies the package version; no external POM, Maven installation, repository cache, or plugin downloads are needed. Use `--help` for usage.

For API Review Hub, the build-tools wrapper obtains the pinned main JAR once and copies it into `$(BinOutputDirectory)`. The generation wrapper builds the requested package's sources JAR, then runs the downloaded tool from `$(BinDirectory)` with output directed to `$(ArtifactOutputDirectory)`. Pass the package path relative to `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)`.

Normal SDK package builds may still restore their own dependencies; standalone review generation does not. The two language-owned ARH wrappers remain required.

## Maven execution

The Maven goal reads the module's existing `pom.xml`; no plugin declaration or new SDK-repository scripts are needed.

From a library module, run its normal build followed by the plugin:

```shell
mvn package com.azure.tools:api-review-maven-plugin:1.0.0-beta.1:generate
```

The package build must produce a `-sources.jar`. Custom `build.finalName` values are supported using the project's embedded Maven metadata. To reuse a previously built JAR:

```shell
mvn com.azure.tools:api-review-maven-plugin:1.0.0-beta.1:generate -Dapi-review.sourcesJar=/path/to/library-1.0.0-sources.jar
```

Resolve released versions through the Azure SDK Java dev feed using the SDK repository's existing Maven settings.

| Property | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `api-review.sourcesJar` | Attached sources artifact, otherwise `target/${project.build.finalName}-sources.jar` |
| `api-review.outputDirectory` | `${project.build.directory}/api-review` |
| `api-review.packageRelativePath` | Module path relative to the nearest ancestor containing `.git` |
| `api-review.repositoryRoot` | Optional root override for exported sources without Git metadata |
| `api-review.skip` | `false`; aggregator POMs are skipped automatically |

For an explicit module path, including sparse or exported checkouts:

```shell
mvn com.azure.tools:api-review-maven-plugin:1.0.0-beta.1:generate -Dapi-review.packageRelativePath=sdk/serialization/azure-json
```

Both modes record the literal package version and forward-slash repository-relative path. `apiHash` is lowercase SHA-256 of the complete UTF-8, no-BOM, LF-normalized Markdown with one trailing newline. Existing bundles are preserved if generation or replacement fails.

## Develop

Use Maven 3.6.3+ and JDK 8+:

```shell
mvn -f packages/java-packages/api-review-maven-plugin/pom.xml clean verify
```

The plugin includes the shared processor sources and resources from `src/java/apiview-java-processor`; there is no separately published processor dependency. `verify` checks Maven invocation and standalone execution of a copied JAR without a POM or Maven cache, comparing both bundles byte-for-byte. CI also verifies the standalone processor.

## Release

Run `release.yml` manually from `main` in the internal project, opting into `publishDevFeed`. It builds and tests on Linux, then ESRP-signs all three JARs and GPG-signs/publishes the plugin JAR, POM, sources, and Javadoc to the Java dev feed on Windows. Existing versions cannot be overwritten.
Supply the ESRP service connection, identity, vault, and certificate parameters from the EngSys signing configuration. Register `ci.yml` as `tools - api-review-maven-plugin - ci` and `release.yml` as an internal release pipeline.
