            "comment": "Here is a summary of the service described by this APIView:\n\nOverview:\nThis API provides a clinical matching service intended for processing patient clinical data and matching it against clinical trial criteria. It facilitates the submission, evaluation, and management of trial matching requests and results, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous workflows via long-running operations and context management.\n\nAPI Version:\nClients accept an `api_version` parameter during initialization; however, no separate API Version object or explicit latest version is defined in this view.\n\nClient Classes:\nThe primary client classes are `ClinicalMatching` (synchronous) and `ClinicalMatchingClient` (asynchronous). Both expose methods including `__init__`, `begin_match_trials`, `create_trials`, `trials`, `erase_trials`, `close`, and `send_request`.\n\nModels and Support Classes:\nA comprehensive set of models is provided under the `azure.healthinsights.clinicalmatching.models` namespace. These models represent structures for trial matching data and clinical information, including types such as `TrialMatcherData`, `TrialMatcherResult`, and `TrialMatcherPatientResult`, as well as configuration types like `TrialMatcherModelConfiguration`. Additionally, several enums (for example, `AgeUnit`, `ClinicalDocumentType`, `JobStatus`, and others) and additional data classes cover clinical trial details, patient records and documents, geographic data, and other related clinical properties.\n\nStructure and Functionality:\nThe API is structured to support long-running operations using pollers (`LROPoller` and `AsyncLROPoller`) and integrates distributed tracing via the `distributed_trace` and `distributed_trace_async` decorators. It manages various input types (e.g., structured objects, JSON, and IO streams) through method overloads, providing flexibility for different client use cases while maintaining robust context management in both synchronous and asynchronous environments.",
