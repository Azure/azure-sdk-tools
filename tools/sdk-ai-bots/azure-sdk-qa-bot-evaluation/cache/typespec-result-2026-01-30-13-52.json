When you get a breaking change review, if this is explained with an appropriate comment, this is likely to be justified as a bug fix.\nOn changing PATCH to synchronous.  ARM does support async PATCH operations, although REST API Guidelines discourage async PATCH operations.  If this operation is synchronous in the previous stable version, then this change is a real breaking change that you will need to justify in breaking change review.\nSimilarly, making PUT and DELETE Asynchronous is a breaking change if these operations were synchronous in the previous stable version is a real breaking change, and you will need to justify the change in a breaking change review.",

            "answer": "1. Removal of a readonly field like 'provisioningState' from the PATCH operation model (e.g., ConfigurationPropertiesUpdate) is NOT a breaking change and should NOT be flagged as such. According to Azure and ARM guidelines, properties that are calculated by the service and marked as readonly (such as provisioningState) should only appear in response models, not in request models for PUT/PATCH. The PATCH request body should only include properties that are updatable by the client. If your PATCH model omits provisioningState, this is correct and compliant with best practices. If the breaking change tooling flags this as a removal, it is a false positive and can be safely ignored or suppressed with justification.\n\n2. Changing CUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations to be Long Running Operations (LROs) in a new API version is allowed and is NOT a breaking change for previous versions. The correct approach is:\n- Introduce the LRO pattern (e.g., 202/202+Location/Azure-AsyncOperation headers) only in the new API version.\n- Do NOT change the behavior of existing API versions; they must remain synchronous if they were previously synchronous.\n- Use TypeSpec ARM templates such as ArmCreateOrReplaceAsync, ArmResourcePatchAsync, ArmResourceDeleteAsync for the new version, and keep the old version using the synchronous templates.\n- If the operation signature changes (e.g., request/response body), use the @added/@removed decorators to version the operations and models accordingly.\n- If you need to support both synchronous and asynchronous behavior in the same API version (based on customer input), you must clearly document the behavior and ensure the OpenAPI spec reflects the possible status codes and headers.\n\nSummary: For PATCH, readonly fields should not be present in the request model. For LRO, only introduce the async pattern in the new API version, and keep old versions unchanged. Use TypeSpec versioning decorators and ARM templates to ensure correct separation and avoid breaking changes.",

Removal of a readonly field like 'provisioningState' from the PATCH operation model (e.g., ConfigurationPropertiesUpdate) is NOT a breaking change and should NOT be flagged as such. According to Azure and ARM guidelines, properties that are calculated by the service and marked as readonly (such as provisioningState) should only appear in response models, not in request models for PUT/PATCH.

This is important in scenarios such as:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An update to a dependency or sub-dependency introduces an unexpected breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Updates to a new version of a service should not impact older versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Modifications are made to the TypeSpec specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese issues can be mitigated with a few precautionary measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Defend against dependency changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: This section applies if using `tsp install` or `npm install` to install dependencies. However other package managers (`yarn`, `pnpm`, etc.) have their own similar lock mechanisms._\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen using `tsp install` or `npm install` a `package-lock.json` will be installed. This file SHOULD be committed to source control. It will ensure that later calls to `tsp install` or `npm install` will use the exact versions resolved in the lock files unless the `package.json` was updated or a command like `npm update` was run.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe command `npm ci` can also be used in the CI to ensure that the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are in sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Work with multiple versions of a service\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a library `@typespec/versioning` that can be used to describe changes to a service or library over time. Using this will ensure that a service can evolve while keeping track of the changes and allowing emitters to see the service representation at different versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[See versioning docs](../libraries/versioning/reference/index.mdx)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Change to the TypeSpec spec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you don't directly control the spec, you might still want to make sure you remember which exact definition was used.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUsing version control and pinning to a specific commit SHA will ensure that the spec will remain exactly as it was.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

The big change to our typespec definition is that we will be moving most of the request properties from query parameters to the request body.  In 3.0, the only property in the request body was an array of InputTextItem.  InputTextItem is just a string.  All the other relevant data was passed in as query parameters. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn 2025-05-01-preview, we want to add a number of additional properties to the request body, so rather than the body consisting of InputTextItem, we want the body to contain a TranslateBody definition, which in turn contains all of our properties.  I'm not sure how to represent this in the tsp files in a compliant way.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOur translate operation in the routes.tsp file is \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop translate is CustomOperation\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n InputTextItem[],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslateParameters,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslationResult,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n ErrorResponse\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u003e; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe first member of the template is the request body and I need it to be InputTextItem[] for 3.0 and I need it to be TranslateBody for 2025-05-01-preview.  Otherwise one of them will have the wrong set of arguments.  I considered simply updating InputTextItem to contain all the needed parameters in TranslateBody and then removing the unused ones with @added decorators, but the problem is we have a number of other operators in 2025-05-01-preview which use InputTextItem and require it to be just the text string.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there anyway to have two different translate operations such that one is called by 3.0 and one is called by 2025-05-01-preview?

Service owners should plan for at least 6-8 weeks (about 2 months) for the process to be completed. Here are the process steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 1. Intake Preparation (Owner: Service PM)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1-3 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Create a new intake using the template for breaking changes: \\\\\\\\u003chttps://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/create/Scenario?templateld=c815af37-5520-43ff-90c8-d985eaabcb6c\\\\\\\\u0026ownerld=85bb92fb-21fe-41ca-9309-47f2c5f57515\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Save Intake Request as New.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Please assign the intake to the service owner PM.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Breaking Change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Please ensure your request shows up in the dashboard (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_dashboards/dashboard/f7db6895-7137-4695-b3f5-00dc4d36758f\\\\\\\\u003e)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Send email to @azbreakchangereview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Attend weekly Office Hours to talk through the breaking change and seek approval. The office hours are on Mondays, 10 AM to 11 AM Pacific Time. Meeting details can be found here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Intake Evaluation (Owner: Service PM/Breaking Change review board)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1-2 weeks\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Validate high-level business justification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- What is the proposal that is being reviewed?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Why do you need this breaking change?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- What will your team do if the breaking change is not approved? There is a high chance the breaking change will NOT be approved.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Customer experience impact.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Number of customers affected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- How can you reduce the impact on customers?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Intake decision (Owner: Breaking change Review Board)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1-3 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Reviewing all the information, the Breaking Change Review Board will decide whether to approve the proposal, change it, or disapprove it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 4. Intake approval from Azure REST API board (Owner: Service PM)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1 week\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Once approved by the Breaking Change Review Board, status of the intake will be marked as approved by the Breaking Change Review Board.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- If there is an SDK impact- then the proposal should be reviewed by API board to seek approval. Reference the API Breaking change documentation: \\\\\\\\u003chttps://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/Guidelines.md#api-changes-that-require-a-version-change\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage the SDK team and the SDK Review board to minimize the impact on client libraries.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Service teams should not implement the change until all approvals have been received.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 5. Communication Readiness (Owner: Service PM/Azure Marketing/CSS)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 2-6 weeks\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Service team owners will need to work with Azure PMM/ Service PM/ Sharon Loh (Breaking change Team - Marketing) - to lock on communication template. If breaking change impacts more than 20,000 subscription IDs, the customer email will be reviewed by assigned editorial team and needs marketing GM and at least one marketing CVP approval. This process will take 2 to 4 weeks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage MS DOC team to update content.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage Business planning team to update price, if appropriate\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage assigned Azure PMM to update marketing assets and ACOM.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage Comms Team for avoiding negative press.

Any new fields must be removed when responding to an old client. Also, old clients may update the resource which may delete fields added by a newer client. For version/state resiliency, we recommend using PATCH (with JSON merge patch) instead of PUT (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFK6RRTwXCg\\\\\\\\u003e).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Changing a resource's field constraints is also problematic. For example: Changing a string's maximum length is a breaking change because a new client could set a long string and an old client can't get/set it back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document informs Azure service teams of the impact to customers when making service changes and versioning. For more information, please see this video (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG984__6dSO\\\\\\\\u0026list=PL9XzOCngAkqs4m0XdULJu_78nM3Ok3Q65\\\\\\\\u0026index=14\\\\\\\\u003e).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe two tables below describe what kind of changes a service can make in a new api-version or after a breaking change review. The tables focus on service API contracts, are not exhaustive, and do not address service behavior changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure requires that any API contract change requires a new api-version; some footnotes (below) allow a few exceptions here. Failure to change the service's API contract without a new api-version can cause confusion especially if the new features are not rolled out to all clouds before documented to users. Here are some examples that cause confusion (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG984_L6dSO\\\\\\\\u0026list=PL9XzOCngAkqs4m0XdULJu_78nM3Ok3Q65\\\\\\\\u0026index=14\\\\\\\\u003e):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Customers can't tell from a specific api-version's documentation whether it includes a new feature or not.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Azure support can't know if an api-version honors a new feature or not to help customers.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Customers can tell if a version of an SDK client library supports a new feature or not.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSome additional notes about the sections below:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Renaming a query parameter/header/field is equivalent to removing it and adding a new one. So, renames are always considered breaking and must be avoided.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Changing a resource's schema (which spans all api-versions) must be taken with great care. Any new fields must be removed when responding to an old client. Also, old clients may update the resource which may delete fields added by a newer client. For version/state resiliency, we recommend using PATCH (with JSON merge patch) instead of PUT (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFK6RRTwXCg\\\\\\\\u003e).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Changing a resource's field constraints is also problematic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Table 1: Changes requiring a new api-version of the service\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Change | Why this change is non-breaking for old clients |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|--------|------------------------------------------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add an extensible enum (string) value | Clients see this as a string value.

Retirements must be discussed with Azure Retirements Reviewers (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://dev.azure.com/msazure/AzureWiki/_wiki/wikis/AzureWiki.wiki/88597/Azure-Retirement-Policy-and-Process\\\\\\\\u003e). Based on the outcome this breaking change may be doable in a new api-version of the service. And, in some extreme cases, this breaking change may be doable in an existing api-version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**NOTE:** These changes are strongly discouraged:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change | Why this change is breaking for old clients |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add pagination support | Old client expects response to include all results and will only ever see 1st page |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add required input | Old client doesn't send this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove input/output | Old client always sends/expects this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add new output enum value | Old client will crash when deserializing |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove input/output enum value | Old client sends/expects this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove extensible enum (string) value\\\\u00b2 | Old client sends/expects this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change input from optional to required | Old clients don't send this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change output from optional to required | New client doesn't expect nullable field (for some language SDKs) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change input/output required to optional | Client code stops compiling due to change in SDK method parameters |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change case (ex: RBAC to Rbac) | Old client sends wrong case |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change format (ex: minutes to time) | Old client can't parse new format |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change data type (ex: bool to string) | Old client can't parse new type's value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Widen input integer (ex: Int32 to Int64) | Old client doesn't expect larger value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Widen output integer (ex: Int32 to Int64) | Old client loses precision |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Narrow input/output integer (ex: Int64 to Int32) | New service loses precision |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Strengthen input constraint (ex: max value 5 to 4) | Old client sends bigger value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Weaken output constraint (ex: max value 5 to 6) | Old client gets value it never expected |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change default value | Old client doesn't expect new default behavior |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change discriminator field value | Old client doesn't expect/send new value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change input parameter order in swagger | Client code stops compiling due to change in SDK method parameter order |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove body Content-Type (ex: application/json) | Old client doesn't expect request to fail |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add response code |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Changing Property to Optional with Default\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Changing Property to Optional with Default\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Changing Property to Optional with Default\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi everyone, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am making a property optional in typespec and to be a non-breaking change, I see that is required to have a default. However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_resource_manager_rpc\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"v1.0#patch-resource.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Patch Resource #\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/cloud-and-ai-microsoft/resource-provider-contract/blob/master/v1.0/patch-resource.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Patch Resource #\\\\\\\\n## Rules ##\\\\\\\\n### General impact of violating the rules ###\\\\\\\\n# v1.0#patch-resource.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Patch Resource #\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Rules ##\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### General impact of violating the rules ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProviding support for `Patch` for as many properties as possible helps avoid accidental and unintentional updates to other properties that need not be touched.

Let's start with a basic example. Assume we have a service with a single API that returns a list of widgets. We can define that API like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Rest;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Error {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  code: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  message?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 2 of the service, we add a get operation to retrieve a single widget. We can add that like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget/{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop get(...Resource.KeysOf\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 3 of the service, we realize that `name` is not accurate and that this field should be called `description`. Also, we decide that the description should be optional, not mandatory. We can implement these changes like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  widgetId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe made the change to the actual model property so that it now reflects the correct name and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, the OpenAPI definition for versions 1 and 2 still reflect the original name and the mandatory nature of the property:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    name:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is a common pattern with the versioning decorators. The TypeSpec should represent the _current state_ of the API. The decorators indicate the version at which this definition became accurate and, depending on the decorator, the other parameters reflect the previous values to retain that information.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#arm#resource-operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ARM Resource Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/resource-operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# ARM Resource Operations\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec Operation Templates and Interface Templates\\\\\\\\n### Determining Which Resource Properties Appear in Lifecycle Operations\\\\\\\\n# howtos#arm#resource-operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# ARM Resource Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec Operation Templates and Interface Templates\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Determining Which Resource Properties Appear in Lifecycle Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, any property that occurs in your resource model will also appear in the response to GET,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPUT, PATCH, and LIST operations, and in the request for PUT and PATCH operations. This does not work\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nfor all properties. Some properties are calculated by the service and cannot be directly set by PUT\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nor PATCH (provisioningState, modification date, etc.). Some properties can only be set when creating\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\na resource, but always appear in responses (e.g. 'location'). Some properties can only be set when\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nupdating the resource, and appear in responses. Some properties (rarely) may be settable when\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nupdating the resource via PUT or PATCH. To allow using a common resource model, but applying these\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`views` of resources to determine how the resource appear in request and responses, TypeSpec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nprovides the visibility framework. You can see a complete representation of available visibilities\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin the table\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[on Property Visibility and Other Constraints](./resource-type.md#property-visibility-and-other-constraints).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe sections below outline some common scenarios for designing properties with your operations in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmind.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Properties That Are Never Directly Set by the User\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIt is common to have properties that are calculated by the service or otherwise not directly set by\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nthe user, examples include timestamps, dates, values that are only set by specific actions (on/off,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenabled/disabled, provisioningState). You want to make sure that these properties are marked so that\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nthey will appear in responses and not requests. this is done using the `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ndecorator instance:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nprovisioningState: ProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

Removal of a readonly field like 'provisioningState' from the PATCH operation model (e.g., ConfigurationPropertiesUpdate) is NOT a breaking change and should NOT be flagged as such. According to Azure and ARM guidelines, properties that are calculated by the service and marked as readonly (such as provisioningState) should only appear in response models, not in request models for PUT/PATCH. The PATCH request body should only include properties that are updatable by the client. If your PATCH model omits provisioningState, this is correct and compliant with best practices. If the breaking change tooling flags this as a removal, it is a false positive and can be safely ignored or suppressed with justification.\\\\n\\\\n2. Changing CUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations to be Long Running Operations (LROs) in a new API version is allowed and is NOT a breaking change for previous versions. The correct approach is:\\\\n- Introduce the LRO pattern (e.g., 202/202+Location/Azure-AsyncOperation headers) only in the new API version.\\\\n- Do NOT change the behavior of existing API versions; they must remain synchronous if they were previously synchronous.\\\\n- Use TypeSpec ARM templates such as ArmCreateOrReplaceAsync, ArmResourcePatchAsync, ArmResourceDeleteAsync for the new version, and keep the old version using the synchronous templates.\\\\n- If the operation signature changes (e.g., request/response body), use the @added/@removed decorators to version the operations and models accordingly.\\\\n- If you need to support both synchronous and asynchronous behavior in the same API version (based on customer input), you must clearly document the behavior and ensure the OpenAPI spec reflects the possible status codes and headers.\\\\n\\\\nSummary: For PATCH, readonly fields should not be present in the request model. For LRO, only introduce the async pattern in the new API version, and keep old versions unchanged. Use TypeSpec versioning decorators and ARM templates to ensure correct separation and avoid breaking changes.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The 'provisioningState' change in the PATCH request model seems like a bug fix if this field was always read-only.  When you get a breaking change review, if this is explained with an appropriate comment, this is likely to be justified as a bug fix.\\\\nOn changing PATCH to synchronous.  ARM does support async PATCH operations, although REST API Guidelines discourage async PATCH operations.  If this operation is synchronous in the previous stable version, then this change is a real breaking change that you will need to justify in breaking change review.\\\\nSimilarly, making PUT and DELETE Asynchronous is a breaking change if these operations were synchronous in the previous stable version is a real breaking change, and you will need to justify the change in a breaking change review.\\\"}\"}]",

            "answer": "The correct usage of the @typeChangedFrom decorator is to specify the version in which the change occurs, not the version from which the new type is introduced. In your scenario, you should use @typeChangedFrom(v2, model1) on the property, not @typeChangedFrom(v1, model1). This tells TypeSpec that starting from v2, the type of 'body' changed from model1 (which existed in v1) to model2 (introduced in v2). The error occurs because your original usage implies model2 existed in v1, which is not the case.\n\nHere is the corrected TypeSpec code:\n\n```typespec\n@added(v1)\nmodel1;\n\n@added(v2)\nmodel2;\n\n@added(v1)\nfeatureA {\n  @typeChangedFrom(v2, model1)\n  body: model2;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach follows TypeSpec versioning best practices and ensures the correct evolution of your API signature across versions.",

To achieve this, you can use a combination of `@removed`, `@added`, and `@renamedFrom` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2,

and Making Another Parameter Optional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario shows how to add a parameter and make another optional in an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following operation in v1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Make the `location` header parameter optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add a new optional query parameter `orderBy`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can achieve this using the `@madeOptional` and `@added` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @query(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order-by\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      orderBy?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@madeOptional(Versions.v2)` makes `location` optional starting in v2.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the `orderBy` query parameter in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario illustrates converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one across versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following synchronous operation in `v1`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you update this operation to be asynchronous as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdateV1 is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@removed(Versions.v2)` removes the original synchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` keeps the original name for v1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the new asynchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@sharedRoute` ensures both operations can use the same route.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#05-authentication.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Authentication\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/05-authentication\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"#

With recent updates, you can now reference types defined in external namespaces or imported libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example: Referencing an External Type\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuppose you want your generated client library to use a type from an external package instead of the default emitted type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@alternateType(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    fullyQualifiedName: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externallib.ExternalModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    package: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externallib\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel MyModel {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  prop: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, instead of generating `MyModel` in the Python sdk, the emitter will reference `ExternalModel` from `externallib` instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Use Cases\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Integrating with shared types from other services or libraries.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Ensuring consistency across multiple SDKs by reusing common models.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Reducing duplication when types are already defined elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Notes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- The referenced type should be compatible with the intended usage in the generated client library.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#generate-client-libraries#08types.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Generated Types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Generated Types\\\\\\\\n## Client Default Values (Legacy)\\\\\\\\n# howtos#generate-client-libraries#08types.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Generated Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Client Default Values (Legacy)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n:::caution\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `@clientDefaultValue` decorator is legacy functionality that should **only** be used to mitigate SDK breaking changes for brownfield services. **New services should NOT use this decorator.** Instead, use standard TypeSpec patterns for default values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.Legacy.clientDefaultValue` decorator allows you to set a client-level default value for a model property or operation parameter.

This decorator allows you to specify the versions that your API supports and manage changes across these versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example: Defining API Versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet's define two versions of our API, `v1` and `v2`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp title=main.tsp tryit=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"emit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/openapi3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-next-line\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-next-line\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pet Store\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@server(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://example.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Single server endpoint\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-next-line\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace PetStore;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-start\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-end\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We're importing and using a new module, `@typespec/versioning`, which provides versioning support.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `@versioned` decorator is used to define the versions supported by the API, defined in the `Versions` enum.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `Versions` enum specifies two versions: `v1` (1.0) and `v2` (2.0).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Generating OpenAPI Specifications for Different Versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce versions are added, the TypeSpec compiler generates individual OpenAPI specifications for each version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{/* prettier-ignore */}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cFileTree\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- package.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- node_modules/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- tsp-output/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - @typespec/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - openapi3\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      - openapi.1.0.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      - openapi.2.0.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c/FileTree\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGenerating separate specs for each version ensures backward compatibility, provides clear documentation for developers to understand differences between versions, and simplifies maintenance by allowing independent updates to each version's specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBy encapsulating different versions of the API within the context of the same TypeSpec project, we can manage all versions in a unified manner. This approach makes it easier to maintain consistency, apply updates, and ensure that all versions are properly documented and aligned with the overall API strategy.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning\\\\\\\\n## Adding the Versioning Library\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Adding the Versioning Library\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore we can use the versioning decorators, we need to add the `@typespec/versioning` library to our project.

Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins. What is the suggestion here? Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_07_03.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"How to update any model without affecting old API versions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# How to update any model without affecting old API versions\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_07_03.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How to update any model without affecting old API versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi team,  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI have a model in the v2_preview version, and now with the new v3_preview version, I want to update a pattern and add some additional fields.

So, modifying them directly will affect all versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are two main approaches:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWorkaround with a new model: You can create a new model with a different name and use @renamedFrom, but this leads to a cascade of renames across operations, which is not ideal.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nApply the change across all versions: If the new regex is backwards compatible, and the change reflects how the service actually behaves across all versions, then it\\\\u2019s appropriate to update the existing model and apply the change to all API versions. This avoids inconsistencies and unnecessary duplication.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn practice, name validation changes usually apply across all versions, so updating the shared model is acceptable. Just be aware that this may be considered a breaking change depending on your service\\\\u2019s governance, and you might need approval.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getstarted#azure-core#step09.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"9.

It is a best practice to add versioning support to your specification from the first version. To do that, you will need to define an `enum` containing your service versions and then apply the `@versioned` decorator to your service namespace.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is an example for the `WidgetManager` service:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things to point out here:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We define an `enum` called `Versions` inside of the service namespace. For each service version, we map a version symbol like `v2022_08_31` to a version string like `2022-08-31`. This service currently only has a single version, but we can add more to this enum as things change over time.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We add the `@versioned` decorator and reference the `Versions` enum we defined using the fully-qualified name `Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions`. This marks the service as being versioned and specifies the set of versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We change the `@useDependency` decorator we used previously to now link each service version to a specific version of `Azure.Core`. See the [Using Azure.Core Versions](#using-azurecore-versions) section for more information.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nImagine that it's 3 months later and you want to release a new version of your service with some slight changes. Add a new version to the `Versions` enum:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-11-30\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will also need to add the `@useDependency` decorator:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-11-30\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, you can express changes to your service using the `@added` and `@removed` decorators. Here's an example of adding a new property to `Widget` and removing an old one:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A widget. */\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_http_specs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"versioning#returntypechangedfrom#main.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Usages for Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/packages/http-specs/specs/versioning/returntypechangedfrom/main.tsp\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Usages for Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\\n## Scenario: This operation should be generated with latest version's signature.\\\\\\\\n# versioning#returntypechangedfrom#main.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Usages for Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Scenario: This operation should be generated with latest version's signature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@post\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@returnTypeChangedFrom(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Versions.v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    contentType: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    @body\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    body: int32,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop test(@header contentType: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", @body body: string): {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  contentType: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @body\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  body: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#versioning#guide.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/guide\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Tutorial\\\\\\\\n## Versioning APIs\\\\\\\\n# libraries#versioning#guide.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Tutorial\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Versioning APIs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe versioning library simplifies the process of versioning APIs. Let's start with a basic example. Assume we have a service with a single API that returns a list of widgets. We can define that API like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Rest;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Error {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  code: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  message?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 2 of the service, we add a get operation to retrieve a single widget. We can add that like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget/{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop get(...Resource.KeysOf\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 3 of the service, we realize that `name` is not accurate and that this field should be called `description`. Also, we decide that the description should be optional, not mandatory. We can implement these changes like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  widgetId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe made the change to the actual model property so that it now reflects the correct name and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, the OpenAPI definition for versions 1 and 2 still reflect the original name and the mandatory nature of the property:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    name:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is a common pattern with the versioning decorators. The TypeSpec should represent the _current state_ of the API. The decorators indicate the version at which this definition became accurate and, depending on the decorator, the other parameters reflect the previous values to retain that information.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"What decorator should be used in this case?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# What decorator should be used in this case?\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# What decorator should be used in this case?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi team, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version v2, we introduced a new model model2 and updated featureA (originally added in v1) to use model2 as its parameter.

remove the older preview version?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi team, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe are adding 2025-11-01 GA and 2025-11-15-preview in TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor 2025-11-01 GA:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdds new features feature1, feature2 compared to the last GA (2023-04-15)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdds new models model1, model2 compared to the last GA (2023-04-15)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor 2025-05-15-preview (older preview):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlready contains feature1, feature2, plus feature3, feature4 (which we do not want to expose in 2025-11-01 GA)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nContains models model1p, model2p (corresponding to model1, model2 but with different names) and model3p, model4p (which we also do not want to expose in 2025-11-01 GA)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor 2025-11-15-preview (new preview):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nShould align naming with 2025-11-01 GA\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIncludes feature1, feature2, feature3, feature4\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIncludes model1, model2, model3p, model4p\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo simplify in TypeSpec, I think the easiest approach is to place GA versions together, since between GA releases we only need @added. Otherwise, we\\\\u2019d have to @remove from the older preview and then @add the not-exposed features/models again in the new preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSo can we order the versions in enum Versions like:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2023-04-15, 2025-11-01, 2025-05-15-preview, 2025-11-15-preview\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis way, feature/model additions and renamings are handled more straightforwardly. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOne more question: should we remove the older preview once we add a newer preview? For example, in this case, would we remove 2025-05-15-preview, keeping only 2023-04-15, 2025-11-01, and 2025-11-15-preview?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThank you so much!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe current policy is to have a single preview version for Azure services. So removing the old preview and replacing the new one is the correct approach. However I do think you'll also need to delete the swagger for the CI to pass\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

Mention in a comment on your PR the PR assignee asking to apply the suppression. Provide justification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      See [valid suppression reasons](#valid-suppression-reasons).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. If you applied permanent suppression:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. It will manifest by the PR getting a label `SuppressionReviewRequired`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Verify the suppression works by the check changing from **failed** to **neutral**.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Wait until your suppression is reviewed. If it is approved, the approved will add the `Approved-Suppression` label.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1.

The sdk failures for flattenProperty are due to those SDKs not being up-to-date with the latest version of typespec-client-generator-core, which was released earlier this week.  Since you are not checking this spec in to the main branch of the private repo, these can be safely ignored.\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

This is important in scenarios such as:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An update to a dependency or sub-dependency introduces an unexpected breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Updates to a new version of a service should not impact older versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Modifications are made to the TypeSpec specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese issues can be mitigated with a few precautionary measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Defend against dependency changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: This section applies if using `tsp install` or `npm install` to install dependencies. However other package managers (`yarn`, `pnpm`, etc.) have their own similar lock mechanisms._\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen using `tsp install` or `npm install` a `package-lock.json` will be installed. This file SHOULD be committed to source control. It will ensure that later calls to `tsp install` or `npm install` will use the exact versions resolved in the lock files unless the `package.json` was updated or a command like `npm update` was run.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe command `npm ci` can also be used in the CI to ensure that the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are in sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Work with multiple versions of a service\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a library `@typespec/versioning` that can be used to describe changes to a service or library over time. Using this will ensure that a service can evolve while keeping track of the changes and allowing emitters to see the service representation at different versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[See versioning docs](../libraries/versioning/reference/index.mdx)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Change to the TypeSpec spec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you don't directly control the spec, you might still want to make sure you remember which exact definition was used.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUsing version control and pinning to a specific commit SHA will ensure that the spec will remain exactly as it was.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use `package-lock.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Use [versioning library](../libraries/versioning/reference/index.mdx)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3.

The [Breaking Changes(Cross-Version) detected problems](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/22834/checks?check_run_id=43004413278). How to fix it?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt depends.  Even across versions, some changes are discouraged/disallowed.  If the breaking changes reported in your PR are all intentional, then you just need to follow the instructions in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"next steps to merge\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" comment to work with the breaking changes board for approval: https://aka.ms/brch\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGenerally, breaking changes between preview api-versions are allowed if there are good reasons,  breaking changes relative to a stable api-version are more of a concern.  Also, if preview api-versions are old enough, they count as stable api-versions (I doubt that is the case here).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe case here is a preview with breaking changes relative to the last stable. And in this case, making a property optional would be considered breaking if the property occurs in responses.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#07-custom-response-models.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Custom Response Models\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/07-custom-response-models\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Custom Response Models\\\\\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#getting-started-rest#07-custom-response-models.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Custom Response Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this section, we focused on creating custom response models in your REST API.

One is with the [TypeSpec `enum` statement](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/enums), e.g.:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- To retain the quotes from the enum values --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Color {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"red\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"green\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnother is to use the union operation to define the enum values inline, e.g.:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  size?: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"medium\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### default\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA model property that specifies a default value using \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will produce a `default` field in the schema for this property.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  answer?: int32 = 42;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  color?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"purple\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nproduces\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nanswer:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: integer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  format: int32\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  default: 42\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncolor:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  default: purple\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Host / BasePath / Servers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI v2, the `host` and `basePath` fields at the top-level of the API definition combine to form the base URL for the API. The paths defined in the `paths` object are appended to this base URL to form the absolute URL for an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI v3, the top-level `servers` field specifies an array of `server` objects [[v3][v3-server]] with a base URL, which may be parameterized, to which the operation path is appended.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-server]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#server-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, the `host` in OpenAPI v2 or `servers` in OpenAPI v3 can be specified with the `@server` decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\non the namespace (from `@typespec/http` library). You can use this decorator multiple times to specify multiple servers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Paths Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI, the `paths` object [[v2][v2-paths], [v3][v3-paths]] is the top-level structure for defining the operations of the API, organized by the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"path\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v2-paths]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#paths-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-paths]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#paths-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, you can specify the path for a namespace, interface, or operation using the `@route` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the value of the `@route` decorator contains path parameters, operations within the scope of the decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmust declare parameters with the same name and type. If an operation declares a path parameter that is not present\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin the route, this defines a new path that is the value from the `@route` decorator with the path parameter appended.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Pets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op create(@body pet: Pet): Pet; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op read(@path petId: int32): Pet; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets/{petId}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the `@route` decorator is used within a namespace or interface that also has a `@route` decorator, the path is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nobtained by concatenating the routes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Widgets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // widgets operations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/{id}/parts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  namespace Parts {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    op list(@path id: string): Part[] | Error; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widgets/{id}/parts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Path Item Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI, a path item object [[v2][v2-pathitem], [v3][v3-pathitem]] describes the operations available on a single path. A path may have at most one `get`, `put`, `post`, `patch`, `delete`, or `head` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v2-pathitem]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#path-item-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-pathitem]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#path-item-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, operations are defined within a namespace or interface with a syntax similar to typescript functions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe HTTP method for an operation can be specified explicitly using a decorator: `@get`, `@put`, `@post`, `@patch`, `@delete`, or `@head`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf an HTTP method decorator is not specified then the default is `post` if there is a body and `get` otherwise.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@tag(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Gadgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/gadgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Gadgets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op create(@body gadget: Gadget): Gadget | Error; // uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"post\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" method\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op read(@path id: string): Gadget | Error; // uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" method\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOther path item fields:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| OpenAPI `pathItem` field | TypeSpec construct | Notes                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `summary`                |                    |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#04-common-parameters.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Common Parameters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/04-common-parameters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Common Parameters\\\\\\\\n## Introduction\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#getting-started-rest#04-common-parameters.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Common Parameters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Introduction\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this section, we'll focus on reusing common parameters in your REST API.

new preview API\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReplacing a preview API with a stable API\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReplacing a preview API with a stable API and a new preview API\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdding a preview API (previous stable API)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nConverting existing specs with mixes of preview and stable APIs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that, in this new scenario, new services will always have only a single version in their specs until they have their first stable version.  This should drastically reduce the amount of decoration in preview APIs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Add a new stable version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### TypeSpec Steps\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Check the Latest Version\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Determine whether the latest version is a preview version or a stable (GA) version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. If the Latest Version is Stable (GA):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Add a new entry for the new stable version at the bottom of the Versions enumeration\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   2. Add a new example folder for the new version and copy any still-relevant examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   3. Make changes to the API using versioning decorators to mark each change\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. if the latest version is preview version: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Add a new stable (GA) version enum before the existing preview enum value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   2. Add a new example folder for the new version and copy any still-relevant examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   3. Update all items that are GA\\\\u2019ing:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      1.

However, due to backend delays, it\\\\u2019s been open since July. During that time, the [typespec migration PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36556) was drafted against our preview API. Now, the service-under-conversion label has been added to our stable PR. I\\\\u2019d like to understand does this label indicate a delay in merging in our [stable api PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36219), or will we need to make additional changes?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe label should not impact your previous PR, and , if this is a later api-version thatn the conversion PR, the conversion would normally be based on that version once checked in.

They are intuitive, naturally reflecting and communicating the underlying model and its behavior. They lend themselves easily to client library implementations in multiple programming languages. And they don't \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get in the way\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the developer, by remaining stable and predictable, _especially over time_.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis document provides Microsoft teams building Azure services with a set of guidelines that  help service teams build great APIs. The guidelines create APIs that are approachable, sustainable, and consistent across the Azure platform. We do this by applying a common set of patterns and web standards to the design and development of the API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor developers, a well defined and constructed API enables them to build fault-tolerant applications that are easy to maintain, support, and grow. For Azure service teams, the API is often the source of code generation enabling a broad audience of developers across multiple languages.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure Service teams should engage the Azure HTTP/REST Stewardship Board early in the development lifecycle for guidance, discussion, and review of their API. In addition, it is good practice to perform a security review, especially if you are concerned about PII leakage, compliance with GDPR, or any other considerations relative to your situation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIt is critically important to design your service to avoid disrupting users as the API evolves:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#principles-api-versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"principles-api-versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003e:white_check_mark:\\\\\\\\u003c/a\\\\\\\\u003e **DO** implement API versioning starting with the very first release of the service.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#principles-compatibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"principles-compatibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003e:white_check_mark:\\\\\\\\u003c/a\\\\\\\\u003e **DO** ensure that customer workloads never break\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#principles-backward-compatibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"principles-backward-compatibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003e:white_check_mark:\\\\\\\\u003c/a\\\\\\\\u003e **DO** ensure that customers are able to adopt a new version of service or SDK client library **without requiring code changes**\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure#apiVersionEvolution.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Scenarios for API Evolution\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Scenarios for API Evolution\\\\\\\\n## Replacing a Preview API with a new Stable and a Preview API (previous stable API exists)\\\\\\\\n### TypeSpec Steps\\\\\\\\n# azure#apiVersionEvolution.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Scenarios for API Evolution\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document describe how to evolute api version for a management plane services.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Scenarios to Consider\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nadd a new stable version\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nadd a new preview version\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMaking a preview api stable\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReplacing a preview API with a new preview API\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReplacing a preview API with a stable API\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nReplacing a preview API with a stable API and a new preview API\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdding a preview API (previous stable API)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nConverting existing specs with mixes of preview and stable APIs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that, in this new scenario, new services will always have only a single version in their specs until they have their first stable version.

If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPR: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/35346\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAvocado check: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/35346/checks?check_run_id=44368323389 \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there a way to suppress the missing APIs check only for this PR since it only has typspec conversion but no update to the open API spec?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe check is trying to compare the APIs with previous stable release with currently published stable release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPart of the typespec conversion is replacing the existing swagger with a generated swagger.  The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Is TypeSpec migration complete for folder: recoveryservicesbackup.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Is TypeSpec migration complete for folder: recoveryservicesbackup.\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Is TypeSpec migration complete for folder: recoveryservicesbackup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe had PR in flight: [Adding stable 2025 08 01 for completeness by risraj10 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #37381 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/37381)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, I see that TypeSpec migration was done couple of days ago for this folder. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI have cancelled the above PR and trying to raise a new PR.

If you do not need to continue supporting the older preview, you might consider removing it,  otherwise, this is an error you can safely suppress (https://aka.ms/ci-fix is a great link to remember, as it has links to all kinds of useful info about ci errors, including a link to the suppression guides).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor PrivateEndpointConnections, RPs have done both, as the name of the private endpoint connection type doesn't really matter to the API, however, there is a new template that greatly simplifies adding private endpoint connection operations to any resourc,e see: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[typespec-azure/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-end\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/blob/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-endpoints.tsp#L69-L94)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointConnectionResource;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nalias PrivateEndpointOperations = PrivateEndpoints\\\\\\\\u003cPrivateEndpointConnection\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Record\\\\\\\\u003cElement\\\\\\\\u003e type\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Record\\\\\\\\u003cElement\\\\\\\\u003e type\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Record\\\\\\\\u003cElement\\\\\\\\u003e type\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSegmentName = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{recordType}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The etag of the record set.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  etag?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nspecification/ai/Azure.AI.Agents/common/models.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  after?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  before?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  lastId?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  metadata: Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e | null;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  metadata?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e | null;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCould you please confirm whether `Record\\\\\\\\u003cElement\\\\\\\\u003e` is a supported type?

In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"troubleshoot#suppresswarnings.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"How to suppress warnings\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/suppresswarnings\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# How to suppress warnings\\\\\\\\n# troubleshoot#suppresswarnings.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How to suppress warnings\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis article helps you to suppress warning messages generated by TypeSpec and libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Symptoms\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec core and libraries could generate and output warning messages based on linting rules.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Cause\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese linting rules are introduced to ensure high-quality specs being generated.

Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins. What is the suggestion here? Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCI has been failing constantly for our PR ([Azure Load Testing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Add 2025-03-01-preview Data-Plane APIs by Harshan01 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #32585 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/32585)) for Typespec Validation step.

It is similar to TypeScript in syntax, but is specifically designed for describing the shape and behavior of APIs (such as REST, gRPC, or GraphQL), not for general-purpose programming.\nTypeSpec allows you to:\nDefine the interface of your API, including operations, request/response models, and error handling.\nGenerate artifacts such as OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications, SDKs, and documentation from a single source of truth.\nEnforce API design consistency and reduce errors, especially in large organizations or when following strict guidelines (like Azure's API standards).\nReuse and extend models and patterns using TypeSpec libraries and templates.\nFor Azure, TypeSpec has dedicated extensions and libraries that help you follow Azure API guidelines and make it easier to build ARM (Azure Resource Manager) and data-plane services. Using TypeSpec leads to APIs that are easier to review, more consistent, and better supported by tooling.\nYou can get started by installing the TypeSpec CLI and using templates to quickly scaffold a project.

        "expected": {
            "answer": "Let's address both of your issues with the TypeSpec migration and generated Swagger:\n1. Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\n```\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: string;\n// ... other properties ...\n}\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: \"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\";\nrecoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\nAction Items:\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.",

            "answer": "1. Regarding the missing `x-ms-discriminator-value` and the presence of the standard `discriminator` field in the generated Swagger: This is by design. TypeSpec uses the `@discriminator` decorator to indicate the property used for polymorphic serialization, and the OpenAPI emitter generates the standard OpenAPI `discriminator` field. The legacy `x-ms-discriminator-value` extension is not emitted by default in TypeSpec-generated OpenAPI, as the OpenAPI v3 specification now expects the standard `discriminator` field. Azure guidelines require using the standard discriminator mechanism for new specs. If you have a legacy client that depends on `x-ms-discriminator-value`, you would need to add it manually using an OpenAPI extension decorator, but this is discouraged for new Azure services.\n\n2. Regarding the duplicate `objectType` property: This is a modeling issue in your TypeSpec. When you use inheritance (`extends`) and both the base and derived models declare the same property (`objectType`), the property will appear in both places in the generated schema, resulting in duplication. To avoid this, only declare `objectType` in the base model (`AzureBackupRestoreRequest`). In the derived model (`AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest`), set the value of `objectType` as a string literal, like:\n\n```typespec\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\n  objectType: \"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\";\n  recoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the derived model sets the discriminator value correctly and does not duplicate the property definition. The generated OpenAPI will have the correct discriminator mapping and only one `objectType` property per schema.\n\nSummary:\n- The absence of `x-ms-discriminator-value` is by design; use the standard `discriminator` field for new specs.\n- Avoid duplicate discriminator properties by only declaring them in the base model and setting their value as a literal in derived models.",

Regarding the missing `x-ms-discriminator-value` and the presence of the standard `discriminator` field in the generated Swagger: This is by design. TypeSpec uses the `@discriminator` decorator to indicate the property used for polymorphic serialization, and the OpenAPI emitter generates the standard OpenAPI `discriminator` field. The legacy `x-ms-discriminator-value` extension is not emitted by default in TypeSpec-generated OpenAPI, as the OpenAPI v3 specification now expects the standard `discriminator` field. Azure guidelines require using the standard discriminator mechanism for new specs. If you have a legacy client that depends on `x-ms-discriminator-value`, you would need to add it manually using an OpenAPI extension decorator, but this is discouraged for new Azure services.\\\\n\\\\n2. Regarding the duplicate `objectType` property: This is a modeling issue in your TypeSpec. When you use inheritance (`extends`) and both the base and derived models declare the same property (`objectType`), the property will appear in both places in the generated schema, resulting in duplication. To avoid this, only declare `objectType` in the base model (`AzureBackupRestoreRequest`). In the derived model (`AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest`), set the value of `objectType` as a string literal, like:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\n  objectType: \\\\\\\"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\\\\\\\";\\\\n  recoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis ensures that the derived model sets the discriminator value correctly and does not duplicate the property definition. The generated OpenAPI will have the correct discriminator mapping and only one `objectType` property per schema.\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\n- The absence of `x-ms-discriminator-value` is by design; use the standard `discriminator` field for new specs.\\\\n- Avoid duplicate discriminator properties by only declaring them in the base model and setting their value as a literal in derived models.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Let's address both of your issues with the TypeSpec migration and generated Swagger:\\\\n1. Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\\\\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\\\\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\\\\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\\\\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\\\\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\\\\n```\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: string;\\\\n// ... other properties ...\\\\n}\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: \\\\\\\"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\\\\\\\";\\\\nrecoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\\\\nAction Items:\\\\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\\\\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.\\\"}\"}]",

Let's start with a basic example. Assume we have a service with a single API that returns a list of widgets. We can define that API like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Rest;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Error {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  code: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  message?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 2 of the service, we add a get operation to retrieve a single widget. We can add that like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget/{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop get(...Resource.KeysOf\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 3 of the service, we realize that `name` is not accurate and that this field should be called `description`. Also, we decide that the description should be optional, not mandatory. We can implement these changes like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  widgetId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe made the change to the actual model property so that it now reflects the correct name and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, the OpenAPI definition for versions 1 and 2 still reflect the original name and the mandatory nature of the property:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    name:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is a common pattern with the versioning decorators. The TypeSpec should represent the _current state_ of the API. The decorators indicate the version at which this definition became accurate and, depending on the decorator, the other parameters reflect the previous values to retain that information.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#typespec-for-openapi-dev.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers\\\\\\\\n## Schema Object\\\\\\\\n### allOf and polymorphism using allOf\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#typespec-for-openapi-dev.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Schema Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### allOf and polymorphism using allOf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec supports single inheritance of models with the `extends` keyword. This construct can be used to produce an `allOf` with a single element (the parent schema) in OpenAPI.

The structure outlined here is designed to support both ARM (Azure Resource Manager) and data-plane services while maintaining compatibility with both TypeSpec-based and OpenAPI-based API development workflows.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!IMPORTANT]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e The structure described in this article is the **recommended standard** for all new Azure services. While some existing services may follow legacy patterns for historical reasons, all new services must adopt this structure. We are actively working on migrating legacy patterns to align with these guidelines.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key concepts and terminology\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo better understand the directory structure, it's essential to familiarize yourself with these key concepts as defined in the [glossary]:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Service**: A customer-facing Azure service (e.g., Azure Key Vault, Azure Container Registry)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Organization**: The Azure team or group responsible for one or more services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Resource Provider Namespace (RPNS)**: The ARM namespace for resource management operations (e.g., `Microsoft.KeyVault`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **API Version**: All Azure services use the YYYY-MM-DD(-preview) format for consistent versioning.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Overview of the folder structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `specification` folder follows a hierarchical organization designed to accommodate both ARM and data-plane services. The structure ensures clear separation between different service types while maintaining consistency across all Azure service specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nspecification/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003corganization\\\\\\\\u003e/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 cspell.yaml                     # Spell-check configuration\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 resource-manager/               # ARM services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2502   \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e/                    # Resource Provider Namespace\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2502       \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice1\\\\\\\\u003e/             # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2502       \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice2\\\\\\\\u003e/             # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 data-plane/                    # Data-plane services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice1\\\\\\\\u003e/                 # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice2\\\\\\\\u003e/                 # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Organization structure:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEach organization folder contains up to two main directories:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **One `resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e/` folder** for ARM services (where `\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e` is the Resource Provider Namespace) containing **one or more** `\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e` folders\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **One `data-plane/` folder** for non-ARM APIs containing **one or more** `\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e` folders\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important notes:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Organizations may have only ARM services, only data-plane services, or both\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The presence of both directories is not mandatory - it depends on the services offered by the organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### ARM services: `resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e` folder\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\u003corganization\\\\\\\\u003e/resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e` folder corresponds to an ARM **Resource Provider (RP) namespace**.

The TypeSpec team is actively working on new designs to reduce redundancy in example organization.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor detailed information about API versioning practices, see the [API versioning guidelines].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `specification/common-types`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`specification/common-types`] directory serves a special purpose in the repository structure, containing shared definitions that can be reused across all Azure service specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Purpose and usage:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Contains common models, types, and operations used across multiple Azure services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enables consistency and reduces duplication across service specifications\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Provides standardized definitions for common Azure patterns\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important limitations:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to share definitions beyond those available in [`specification/common-types`], you must duplicate them in each service's own folder. This requirement ensures that each service maintains independent control over the versioning lifecycle of shared definitions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Best practice for managing shared definitions:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the maintenance burden of duplicate copies, service teams can implement a shared ownership pattern:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Designate an owner service** - The service that creates or updates the shared models becomes the owner.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. **Create a `sharable/` folder** - The owner service creates this folder to make definitions available for copying.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. **Use `copyFrom*Sharable` folders** - Other services create these folders to indicate copied content that should not be edited directly.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example structure:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`diff\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nspecification/compute/resource-manager/Microsoft.Compute/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 ComputeRP\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 sharable/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 *.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 readme.md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 preview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 stable/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 RecommenderRP\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 copyFromComputeSharable\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 *.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 readme.md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 preview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 stable/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Naming guidelines for `specification` folder contents\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConsistent naming conventions across the repository improve readability and reduce ambiguity.

Instead of having one resource with two distinct rp-specific properties schemas, you generally should have two resources, or have a property of the rp-specific properties be polymorphic. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDiscriminated unions are not yet handled by Azure emitters, so this isn't a good choice for Azure APIs.  You can use inheritance based discrimination instead. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's a sample using inheritance-based discrimination for a property of the rp-specific resource properties. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that you can use the 'kind' envelope property to make a resource polymorphic analogously, but this is, as I indicated, an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `@discriminator` {#@discriminator}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@discriminator` {#@discriminator}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecify the property to be used to discriminate this type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@discriminator(propertyName: valueof string)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Target\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`Model`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Type | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| propertyName | [valueof `string`](#string) | The property name to use for discrimination |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Pet{ kind: string }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Cat extends Pet {kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"cat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", meow: boolean}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog extends Pet  {kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", bark: boolean}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Data types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-data-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `DiscriminatedOptions` {#DiscriminatedOptions}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `DiscriminatedOptions` {#DiscriminatedOptions}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOptions for `@discriminated` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel DiscriminatedOptions\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Type | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| envelope?

These 2 properties are mutually exclusive(ensuring that only one of `awsCloudProfile` or `gcpCloudProfile` can exist at a time). Besides setting both of them to optional, is there any other options in TypeSpec that we can achieve the mutually exclusive without causing a breaking change?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere isn't currently a built-in way in TypeSpec to enforce mutual exclusivity between properties like `awsCloudProfile` and `gcpCloudProfile`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn your PR, you're making both properties optional \\\\u2014 but that\\\\u2019s actually a breaking change. Clients may have previously assumed that `awsCloudProfile` was always present, and now that constraint is being relaxed, which breaks existing behavior.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure's recommended pattern for such cases is to use **explicit discriminated unions** to simplify the client experience. That means defining a `CloudProfile` union with a `@discriminator(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` to clearly indicate which cloud provider the profile belongs to. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```typescript\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nunion CloudProfile {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  aws: AwsCloudProfile;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  gcp: GcpCloudProfile;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel AwsCloudProfile {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aws\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  awsAccountId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel GcpCloudProfile {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gcp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  projectProperties?: GcpProjectProperties;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  organizationProperties?: GcpOrganizationProperties;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  isOrganization?: boolean = false;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWith this structure, your `CloudConnectorProperties` model just needs a single `cloudProfile` property. It allows you to support AWS, GCP, or any other provider in future API versions without breaking changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo clarify a few key points:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Is the `kind` property set by the customer?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   Yes, it appears on the wire. In some SDKs, the customer needs to set it explicitly; in others, it may be inferred by the SDK type system.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. **Does `kind` already exist in your types?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   No, it doesn\\\\u2019t. This change would be a breaking change \\\\u2014 but one that allows forward compatibility when adding more cloud providers.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. **Would the `hostType` property still be needed?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   No, it would become redundant if you adopt this `@discriminator` union pattern.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs a side note: TypeSpec has introduced a `@discriminated` decorator for unions, which supports more flexible patterns, but it is not yet supported by all SDK emitters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Does `kind` already exist in your types?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   No, it doesn\\\\u2019t.

It\\\\u2019s under investigation and targeted for support around August. However, the `@discriminator` pattern (which you are using here) is already required to be supported by all SDK emitters and is safe to use today.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#generate-client-libraries#08types.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Generated Types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Generated Types\\\\\\\\n## Models\\\\\\\\n### Discriminator\\\\\\\\n# howtos#generate-client-libraries#08types.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Generated Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Discriminator\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ninterface for type Cat.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nfunc (c *Cat) GetCat() *Cat { return c }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntype Ragdoll struct {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t// CONSTANT; undefinedField has constant value \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ragdoll\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", any specified value is ignored.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tKind *string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// GetCat implements the CatClassification interface for type Ragdoll.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nfunc (e *Ragdoll) GetCat() *Cat {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\treturn \\\\\\\\u0026Cat{\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\tKind:     e.Kind,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntype Siamese struct {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t// CONSTANT; undefinedField has constant value \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"siamese\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", any specified value is ignored.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\tKind *string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// GetCat implements the CatClassification interface for type Siamese.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nfunc (e *Siamese) GetCat() *Cat {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\treturn \\\\\\\\u0026Cat{\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\tKind:     e.Kind,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c/ClientTabItem\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c/ClientTabs\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec uses `@discriminator` decorator to add a discriminator to a model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cClientTabs\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cClientTabItem lang=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"typespec\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nClient emitters now only support a single way to represent a discriminated set in TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.

This is supported by context from TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines.\\n3. For the second issue, the RESPONSE explains that duplicate properties arise from declaring the discriminator property in both base and derived models, and provides a modeling solution that matches the TypeSpec documentation and examples (e.g., only declare in base, set literal in derived).\\n4.

Regarding the missing `x-ms-discriminator-value` and the presence of the standard `discriminator` field in the generated Swagger: This is by design. TypeSpec uses the `@discriminator` decorator to indicate the property used for polymorphic serialization, and the OpenAPI emitter generates the standard OpenAPI `discriminator` field. The legacy `x-ms-discriminator-value` extension is not emitted by default in TypeSpec-generated OpenAPI, as the OpenAPI v3 specification now expects the standard `discriminator` field. Azure guidelines require using the standard discriminator mechanism for new specs. If you have a legacy client that depends on `x-ms-discriminator-value`, you would need to add it manually using an OpenAPI extension decorator, but this is discouraged for new Azure services.\\\\n\\\\n2. Regarding the duplicate `objectType` property: This is a modeling issue in your TypeSpec. When you use inheritance (`extends`) and both the base and derived models declare the same property (`objectType`), the property will appear in both places in the generated schema, resulting in duplication. To avoid this, only declare `objectType` in the base model (`AzureBackupRestoreRequest`). In the derived model (`AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest`), set the value of `objectType` as a string literal, like:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\n  objectType: \\\\\\\"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\\\\\\\";\\\\n  recoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis ensures that the derived model sets the discriminator value correctly and does not duplicate the property definition. The generated OpenAPI will have the correct discriminator mapping and only one `objectType` property per schema.\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\n- The absence of `x-ms-discriminator-value` is by design; use the standard `discriminator` field for new specs.\\\\n- Avoid duplicate discriminator properties by only declaring them in the base model and setting their value as a literal in derived models.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Let's address both of your issues with the TypeSpec migration and generated Swagger:\\\\n1. Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\\\\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\\\\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\\\\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\\\\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\\\\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\\\\n```\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: string;\\\\n// ... other properties ...\\\\n}\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: \\\\\\\"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\\\\\\\";\\\\nrecoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\\\\nAction Items:\\\\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\\\\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.\\\"}\"}]",

This decorator allows you to explicitly specify the desired final state resolution strategy for an LRO operation. The supported values are: \"original-uri\", \"operation-location\", \"location\", and \"azure-async-operation\".\n\nExample usage:\n```typespec\n@Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia(\"azure-async-operation\")\nop createResource(): ArmAcceptedLroResponse<...>;\n```\nThis will ensure that the generated OpenAPI includes the correct `x-ms-long-running-operation-options` with your chosen `final-state-via` value for the operation.\n\nNote: This decorator should be applied directly to the operation you want to customize.",

            "answer": "There is a clear timeframe for brownfield resource providers (RPs) to migrate from OpenAPI Swagger to TypeSpec: all existing (brownfield) services must transition to TypeSpec Azure by March 30, 2026. Starting in Q4FY26, PRs for new API versions that are not based on TypeSpec will be blocked, and SDK releases from non-TypeSpec specs will also be blocked. This requirement is enforced to ensure consistency and quality across Azure APIs.\n\nRegarding migration strategy, mixing TypeSpec with handwritten Swagger is NOT allowed. Services must wholly switch to TypeSpec; partial migration (such as migrating one resource type at a time and mixing TypeSpec with Swagger) is not supported. The migration must result in a single, unified API version for the service, and all resources must be defined in TypeSpec. If your service currently uses different API versions for different resources, you will need to plan for conformance\u2014either by splitting SDKs or achieving version uniformity.\n\nThe recommended approach is to plan and execute a full migration, using the provided OpenAPI-to-TypeSpec conversion tools and following the documented migration process. You should not attempt to mix or phase migration at the resource level using both Swagger and TypeSpec. For guidance and help during migration, refer to the official documentation and community support channels.",

            "answer": "To apply the `x-ms-client-flatten` flag to a top-level resource property when converting an OpenAPI spec to TypeSpec, you should use the `@flattenProperty` decorator from the `Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.Legacy` namespace on the relevant property in your TypeSpec model. This decorator is the direct replacement for the OpenAPI extension and is the recommended approach for migration scenarios where flattening is required for SDK compatibility.\n\nHere is how you can update your TypeSpec:\n\n```typespec\n/**\n * ArcSetting details.\n */\n@parentResource(Cluster)\nmodel ArcSetting is Azure.ResourceManager.ProxyResource<ArcSettingProperties> {\n  ...ResourceNameParameter<ArcSetting>;\n  @doc(\"ArcSetting properties.\")\n  @Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.Legacy.flattenProperty\n  properties: ArcSettingProperties;\n}\n```\n\n**Implications for the SDK if `x-ms-client-flatten` is missing:**\n- If you omit the flattening, the generated SDKs will not flatten the `properties` bag, resulting in less ergonomic client models (i.e., users will need to access properties via `resource.properties.foo` instead of `resource.foo`).\n- This can be a breaking change for existing SDK consumers who expect flattened models, so it is important to preserve this behavior for back-compatibility unless you are intentionally redesigning the API surface.\n\n**Best Practice:**\n- For new services, avoid using flattening unless absolutely necessary. For migration/back-compat, use `@flattenProperty` as shown above.\n- Do not use OpenAPI decorators directly in TypeSpec; always use the TypeSpec-native decorators for Azure services.\n\n**Note:** If your SDK validation fails due to missing flattening, ensure you are using the latest TypeSpec toolset and that the decorator is applied as shown. If you need to restrict flattening to specific languages, you can pass a scope parameter to `@flattenProperty`.\n\nFor more details, see the official migration guidance and decorator documentation.",

            "answer": "For a property in a TypeSpec ARM resource provider model that represents a dictionary (object) mapping strings to strings, you should use the built-in `Record<string>` type.\nFor example:\n```\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\nmetadata?: Record<string>;\n}\n```\nThis models a property (`metadata`) that is an object/dictionary where all keys and values are strings, equivalent to `{ [key: string]: string }` in TypeScript or `Dictionary<string, string>` in .NET.\nYou should not use `{}` (empty model) or just `Record` (without specifying the value type) as these are either incomplete or invalid in TypeSpec. The correct, type-safe way is `Record<string>`, which will be emitted to OpenAPI/Swagger as an `object` with `additionalProperties: { type: \"string\" }`.\nIf your API spec review asks for a 'model', you can define a named type:\n```\nmodel MetadataModel is Record<string>;\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\nmetadata?: MetadataModel;\n}\n```\nBut `Record<string>` is the canonical, recommended approach for a string-to-string dictionary in TypeSpec ARM resource definitions.\nNote: While this is technically correct, ARM guidelines recommend against unbounded dictionary/object types unless absolutely necessary, as they can limit Azure Policy and ARG capabilities. Use with care, and document any supported/expected keys in your @doc comments if possible.",

Do not use `{}` or an untyped model, as TypeSpec requires explicit types. Also, avoid using `Record<unknown>` or mixing known properties with a Record, as per Azure guidelines. If you want to make the property optional, use the `?` suffix as shown above.\n\nExample usage in a resource model:\n\n```typespec\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\n  metadata?: Record<string>;\n}\n```\n\nThis will emit as an OpenAPI schema with `additionalProperties` of type `string`, which is the standard for representing a string-to-string dictionary in Azure ARM specs.",

Refer to [property ordering](#property-ordering) for more details.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Optional properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nProperties can be designated as optional by using the `?` symbol.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  address?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Default values\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nProperties can be assigned a default value using the `=` operator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  address?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wild\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8 = 0;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Property ordering\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nProperties are arranged in the order they are defined in the source. Properties acquired via `model is` are placed before properties defined in the model body. Properties obtained via `...` are inserted at the point where the spread appears in the source.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Pet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel HasHome {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  address: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Cat is Pet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  meow: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...HasHome;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  furColor: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// The resulting property order for Cat is:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// name, age, meow, address, furColor\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Additional properties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `Record\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e` model can be used to define a model with an arbitrary number of properties of type T. It can be combined with a named model to provide some known properties.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are three ways to achieve this, each with slightly different semantics:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Using the `...` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Using the `is` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Using the `extends` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Using the `...` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSpreading a Record into your model implies that your model includes all the properties you have explicitly defined, plus any additional properties defined by the Record. This means that a property in the model could be of a different and incompatible type with the Record value type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// In this example, the Person model has a property `age` that is an int32, but also has other properties that are all strings.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Using the `is` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen using `is Record\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`, it indicates that all properties of this model are of type T. This means that each property explicitly defined in the model must also be of type T.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe example below would be invalid\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person is Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  //   ^ int32 is not assignable to string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut the following would be valid\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person is Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Using the `extends` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `extends` operator has similar semantics to `is`, but it defines the relationship between the two models. In many languages, this would probably result in the same emitted code as `is` and it is recommended to use `is Record\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e` instead.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person extends Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Special property types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### `never`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA model property can be declared as having the type `never`.

This operation doesn't create any nominal relationship between the source and target, making it useful when you want to reuse common properties without generating complex inheritance relationships.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Animal {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  species: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Pet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Animal;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Pet;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// The Dog model is equivalent to the following declaration:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  species: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Extends\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are times when you want to create an explicit relationship between two models, such as when you're generating class definitions in languages that support inheritance.

in JSON format (as shown above). For ProxyOnly resources, the resource provider is the source of truth. ARM will provide best effort values in the header, but the provider should update the values, including missing values, from known metadata. The `systemData` object should be defined in the resource swagger and persisted in provider storage to serve on all responses for the resource (GET, PUT, PATCH).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**You should only update the systemData properties of a resource if there is a change that affects a user-modifiable property in the control plane JSON configuration of that resource.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### POST operations ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor POST operations on tracked resources, ARM will send all the header values. For POST (create) operations on proxy resources, ARM will send all the header values. For POST (action) operations on proxy resources, ARM sends the lastModified* values only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Resource move ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResource move is treated as a combination of creation and deletion. The RP should be consistent with this logic and replace all values accordingly.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nARM passes one single x-ms-arm-resource-system-data header for the complete move operation. For example, if you have 20 resources to be moved in one request, the expectation from RPs is to save the same system data for each of these 20 resources. In this example,  moving 20 resources is equal to creating 20 resources, and therefore, the systemData values are the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### FAQ ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nif there is a change that affects a user-modifiable property in the control plane JSON configuration of that resource. Children resources should have their own systemData values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What is the format of the timestamps being sent? What if the value is null (i.e. can\\\\u2019t supply the createdAt)? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRPs should either return null or emit the property. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Should internal adminstration operations like updating VM images results in an update of the related resources' systemData properties?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOperations should only change the systemData properties if the change affects user-modifiable properties within the resource's JSON configuration. If a user-modifiable property changes, it should update the systemData values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Can I use a new *ByType value? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRPs should only use *ByType values supported by the related enum in the [common types definition](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/common-types/resource-management/v1/types.json). The currently supported *ByType values are User, Application, ManagedIdentity, and Key.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Can I add systemData to my current API version? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNo. Adding systemData is a breaking change and should only be included as part of a new API version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Is there any situation where the RP will have to interpret the values we are passed and do something? Or do we just store the data and return it? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor tracked resources, the values can simply be stored. Since ARM is not aware of all changes to proxy or dataplane-modifiable resources, the values may have to be interpreted for these resource types.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### How should we store the *ByType values so that we do not have to update the API when more values are added to the identity types? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou should store the *ByType values as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Is it OK to collect this data in Microsoft telemetry streams (e.g., Geneva, Kusto, COSMOS, etc.)? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**No.** This data is considered Customer Data [Customer Content and End User Identifiable Information (EUII)] and must **NOT** be collected in any telemetry streams in order to meet our data handling requirements. It should only be included in the activity log for and accessible by each individual customer.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What values should I use for long-running operations? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe systemData properties should reflect the values from when the operation was triggered.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Should I replace the values if the operation fails or is cancelled? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDo not update system data on a request that was rejected synchronously, but keep the values the triggered-time values if an async operation fails or is cancelled. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What is expected for resources that already exist prior to an RP's implementation of systemData? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nARM doesn\\\\u2019t maintain the systemData details and will not fill them up before returning to the client. As a result, as the RP, you are expected to save the values from the first PUT. If the resource already existed prior to your systemData implementation, you can supply null or omit the value when it is not returned by ARM.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Should a parent resource's systemData values be impacted by the creation or modification of children resources? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNo. You should only update the systemData properties of a resource if there is a change that affects a user-modifiable property in the control plane JSON configuration of that resource. Children resources should have their own systemData values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What is the format of the timestamps being sent?

Swagger, but \\\\u2026 TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice. The VS code integration right out of the box is something I've really liked.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### MS Learn\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EXjQ3t7i-z9BpxVUgZVcS6QBxjLYdRLUquX2y8xczNxfbA?e=nesl3Q)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\u201cOne of the highlights [of using TypeSpec] was our ability to author API specs in a very simple and intuitive language. This meant that even [our PMs] who are not engineers were able to understand these API specifications. They could review them, make comments, and participate in designing those APIs.\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Azure AI Content Safety\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EdlE2PYtZ9BKoXQ-R0h-O10B9RidePBT4mwB1JgIqRC01A?e=JRneI2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I find TypeSpec to be much simpler to learn and write compared to Swagger. In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#identifiers.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Identifiers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/identifiers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Identifiers\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#identifiers.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Identifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifiers are names used to reference models, enums, operations, properties, and other entities in TypeSpec. Understanding identifier rules is essential for writing valid TypeSpec code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Identifier syntax rules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn identifier must follow these rules:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Start with**: A letter (a-z, A-Z), emoji, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Followed by**: Any combination of letters, numbers (0-9), emoji, underscores, or dollar signs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Length**: One or more characters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec implements [UAX31-R1b stable identifiers](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#R1b) with the [emoji profile](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Emoji_Profile), providing full Unicode support for international characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `cat`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `Dog`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `_Item2`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `$money$`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `\\\\ud83c\\\\udf89`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `\\\\ud83d\\\\ude80`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u274c `1cat`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u274c `*dog`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Escaping identifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to use reserved keywords or invalid identifiers, TypeSpec provides an escaping mechanism using backticks (`` ` ``). This allows you to use:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Reserved keywords as identifiers\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Identifiers that don't follow normal syntax rules\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Identifiers with special characters or unusual formats\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `enum` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `interface` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop `import`(): void;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `123InvalidName` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `my-special-model` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `User Profile` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#discriminated-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Discriminated Types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/discriminated-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Discriminated Types\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#discriminated-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Discriminated Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec allows for the expression of unions and inheritance.

Here are some resources that can help:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Playground Examples**: Our playground provides ARM and DP examples that serve as excellent models for teams new to TypeSpec Azure. These examples are concise and take full advantage of our standard operation templates. You can use these as a gold standard for your own TypeSpec definitions. Visit the [TypeSpec Azure Playground](https://aka.ms/trytypespec/azure) to explore these examples.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **ARM Samples**: For more specific scenarios, check out our additional [ARM samples](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/tree/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/arm-scenarios). These are tutorial-like examples that cover various scenarios. You can adapt these to fit your specific needs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe playground examples are a great starting point for getting familiar with TypeSpec Azure. As you gain more experience, you can leverage the ARM samples to understand how to apply TypeSpec to a variety of scenarios.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#arm#resource-type.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ARM Resource Types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/resource-type\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# ARM Resource Types\\\\\\\\n## Designing Resource-specific Properties\\\\\\\\n# howtos#arm#resource-type.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# ARM Resource Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Designing Resource-specific Properties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach resource model consists of two distinct parts\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An outer _envelope_ of information that provides metadata for optional standardized ARM functionality, like entity-tags and managed identities, and is processed by Azure Resource Manager.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An inner set of properties that are specific to the resource and are defined by the resource provider.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nModifying the ARM envelope is discussed in later sections on [mixing in standard ARM envelope add-ons](#adding-optional-standard-envelope-properties).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe inner _rp-specific property bag_ consists of all of the properties that the RP needs to manage about the resource. Properties should be completely specified, should not duplicate properties from the _ARM envelope_, and may consist of simple types, arrays, or other complex properties.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is an example of a property bag for the `EmployeeResource` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeResource is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The employee name, using 'Firstname Lastname' notation */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @segment(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"employees\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"employeeName\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nunion EmployeeProvisioningState {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The resource create request has been accepted */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Accepted: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Accepted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The resource is being provisioned */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Provisioning: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Provisioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The resource is updating */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Updating: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Updating\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Resource has been created. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Succeeded: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Succeeded\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Resource creation failed. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Failed: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Failed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Resource creation was canceled. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Canceled: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Canceled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The resource is being deleted */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Deleting: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Deleting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@minValue(50)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@maxValue(70)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeLevel extends int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeResourceId\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends Azure.Core.armResourceIdentifier\\\\\\\\u003c[\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.HR/employees\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@secret\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar Password extends string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Job {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  companyName: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  start: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  end: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  role: string;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Failed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Resource creation was canceled. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Canceled: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Canceled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The resource is being deleted */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Deleting: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Deleting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@minValue(50)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@maxValue(70)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeLevel extends int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeResourceId\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends Azure.Core.armResourceIdentifier\\\\\\\\u003c[\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.HR/employees\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@secret\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar Password extends string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Job {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  companyName: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  start: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  end: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  role: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  notes?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The current title of the employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  title: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read, Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  level: EmployeeLevel;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  employeeId: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  biography?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No biography provided\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  colleagues: EmployeeResourceId[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  employmentHistory: Job[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  password: Password;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningState?: EmployeeProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`EmployeeProperties` specifies the employee metadata that the RP needs to track and manage. Notice that the model uses built-in scalar types like `string` and `int32`, new types built from scalar types with added constraints, like `Password` and `EmployeeLevel`, enumerations of values, like `EmployeeProvisioningState`, and complex types. The individual components of this model are described below.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that _documentation comments on all models and model properties are required when specs are checked in_. Here they are omitted for clarity. The TypeSpec compiler and TypeSpec IDE tooling will emit warning diagnostics if you emit required documentation, and about most of the ARM rules described in this document.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### The `provisioningState` Property for Tracked Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll Tracked Resources are required to implement a 'provisioningState' property in their rp-specific property bag. This is used by ARM and some ARM clients to track the provisioning state of a resource as it is created and deleted. At minimum, the provisioning state must contain the standard terminal values that ARM is looking for. There are contained in the `ResourceProvisioningState` enumeration in the Azure.ResourceManager library. If RPs have other provisioning states they would like to track, they can define their own provisioning state enum, and mix in the value, as shown in the sample above, or they may simply use the standard provisioning state as shown in the sample below:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ResourceProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that this example uses the spread operator `...`, which allows you to simply include the properties from a source model in the target model you are constructing. This has the effect of copying the properties of the source model and their decorations into the target model, without creating any nominal inheritance relationship.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternately, this is also equivalent:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ResourceProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The status of the last provisioning operation performed on the resource. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningState?: ResourceProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required and Optional properties and Property Defaults\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the examples, note that some model properties use the optional operator `?` after the property name, like `biography?` and some do not, like `title`. Property names using the `?` are optional properties, which may or may not be provided in the request body for CreateOrUpdate (PUT) requests. Property names without the `?` are required properties, which must be provided in PUT requests. The exception is that properties that have 'readOnly' visibility do not appear in requests, but may be required or optional in responses.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso note that optional properties may specify defaults, as with `biography?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No biography provided\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. The default indicates the value that will be recorded on the server if no value is sent by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Defining Custom Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the sample, new constrained scalar types and new complex model types are defined and used inside the _rp-specific property bag_. TypeSpec allows you to define custom types for use in your specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will often want to define scalar types or properties that have constraints. For example, numeric values may be constrained to have a certain minimum or maximum, strign values may be constrained to follow a particular regex pattern, and so on. Whenever these constrained types are used in your spec, the constraints will be transmitted to the usage.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe example creates a numeric type with minimum and maximum constraints:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@minValue(50)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@maxValue(70)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeLevel extends int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis defines 'EmployeeLevel' as an integer value between 50 and 70. The example also defines a complex type used in an array:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Job {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  companyName: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  start: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  end: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  role: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  notes?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMode details on what to consider when using complex types in an array are discussed in the section on [modeling arrays of complex types](#modeling-arrays-of-complex-types).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Using Resource identifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is often the case that resources need to reference other resources to provide specific pieces of functionality. For example, resources may need to reference a storage account to use for storing user data, or a NIC to attach to a Network. The `Azure.ResourceManager` library defines a `ResourceIdentifier` template that allows you to easily represent references to resources in your API. The template allows you to specify one or more acceptable resource types, automatically designating the value as a resource reference, and providing the appropriate pattern validation - which helps in generating better code, better ARM templates, and better documentation for your API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeResourceId\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends Azure.Core.armResourceIdentifier\\\\\\\\u003c[\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.HR/employees\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar NetworkInterfaceId\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends Azure.Core.armResourceIdentifier\\\\\\\\u003c[\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/networkInterfaces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `NetworkInterfaceId example shows how to allow multiple resource types in a reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Property Visibility and Other Constraints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sample uses the `@visibility` decorator to indicate how the resource definition is used in requests to PUT and PATCH operations, and in responses to PUT, PATCH, GET, and LIST operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis table shows how visibility is used to determine whether a property is used in requests and responses:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Visibility           | In Create Request? | In Patch Request/ Updateable in PUT | In Responses | Sample                                         |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| None                 | Yes                | Yes                                 | Yes          | Most properties                                |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read, create, update | Yes                | Yes                                 | Yes          | Most properties                                |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read, create         | Yes                | No                                  | Yes          | resource location                              |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read, update         | No                 | Yes                                 | Yes          | Properties only settable after creation (keys) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| create, update       | Yes                | Yes                                 | No           | Secrets (e.g. password)                        |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read                 | No                 | No                                  | Yes          | Calculated properties, e.g. provisioning\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#rest#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/rest/reference/decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Decorators\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec.Rest\\\\\\\\n### `@resource` {#@TypeSpec.Rest.resource}\\\\\\\\n# libraries#rest#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec.Rest\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@resource` {#@TypeSpec.Rest.resource}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMark this model as a resource type with a name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@TypeSpec.Rest.resource(collectionName: valueof string)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Target\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`Model`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name           | Type             | Description            |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| collectionName | `valueof string` | type's collection name |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM.CommonTypes-Models-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes Models Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes Models Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 36.

            "answer": "To add the `x-ms-pageable` extension (with `nextLinkName: \"nextLink\"`) to your TypeSpec operation, you should use the `@list` decorator on your operation. This will ensure that the generated OpenAPI/Swagger includes the correct `x-ms-pageable` extension, as required by Azure ARM and API guidelines.\nHere's how you should modify your TypeSpec:\n```\n@list\n@get\n@action(\"elasticvolumes\")\nlistVolumes is ArmResourceActionSync<\nElasticSnapshotPolicy,\nvoid,\nElasticSnapshotPolicyVolumeList\n>;\nmodel ElasticSnapshotPolicyVolumeList is Azure.Core.Page<ElasticSnapshotPolicyVolume>;\n```\nThe `@list` decorator is what triggers the addition of `x-ms-pageable` in the generated OpenAPI.\nYour model should use the standard ARM paging model, which is `Azure.Core.Page<T>`. This will ensure you have the required `value` and `nextLink` properties, and that `nextLink` is correctly annotated.\nAfter adding `@list`, the generated Swagger/OpenAPI will include:\n```\n\"x-ms-pageable\": {\n\"nextLinkName\": \"nextLink\"\n}\n```\nIf you have a custom response model, make sure it uses the `@pageItems` and `@nextLink` decorators:\n```\nmodel ElasticSnapshotPolicyVolumeList {\n@pageItems\nvalue: ElasticSnapshotPolicyVolume[];\n@nextLink\nnextLink?: string;\n}\n```\nSummary:\nAdd `@list` to your operation.\nUse the ARM paging model or annotate your custom model with `@pageItems` and `@nextLink`.\nNo need to manually add the `x-ms-pageable` extension via `@extension`\u2014the emitter handles this for you when `@list` is present.\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure API guidelines and will resolve your `XmsPageableForListCalls` lintDiff finding.",

The link may encode parameters such as query parameters in HTTP. In such cases those parameters must be passed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example, HTTP links are expected to be opaque and contain all the necessary information for the next page URL. This means that query and path parameters are expected to already have been included in the link.

By default, properties are included in the response if they have Lifecycle.Read visibility, and all properties have all visibilities enabled unless you restrict them with @visibility.\nTherefore, unless you have properties with more restrictive visibilities, all properties will be included in the response by default. If you want to limit which properties are returned, you should annotate those properties with @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) or other appropriate modifiers, but you do not need to explicitly use a visibilityFilter just because a model is a response type.\nIf you use the built-in Lifecycle visibility model as intended, the behavior you expect is implicit and handled automatically for response models.",

For response payloads (such as the return type of a GET operation), only properties marked with @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) will be included in the emitted OpenAPI schema, and those properties will be marked as readOnly. Properties without the Read visibility will be excluded from the response schema.\n\nYou only need to use visibility decorators (like @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)) on the individual properties that should be read-only. The emitter will handle the rest. Explicit use of @withVisibilityFilter is only necessary if you want to create custom filtered views of a model outside the standard lifecycle phases, or if you need a named model with a specific filtered shape for other purposes.\n\nExample:\n```typespec\nmodel Result {\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\n  id: string;\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\n  status: string;\n  // This property will NOT appear in the response\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create)\n  secret: string;\n}\n\n@route(\"/result\")\ninterface Results {\n  @get getResult(): Result;\n}\n```\nIn this example, only 'id' and 'status' will be present in the response schema, and both will be marked as readOnly in OpenAPI. No additional visibilityFilter is required.",

Defining your first resource\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Code explanation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some important points about the code:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `Widget` model has a `@resource` decorator with a parameter of `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"widgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. This string is the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"collection name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the resource and it determines where the resource appears in the service URI layout.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `name` property has a `@key` decorator with a parameter of `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"widgetName\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. This string customizes the name of the path parameter (and the parameter name itself) in operations that use this resource type. Note that there _must_ be one property with a `@key` decorator on all resource types!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` decorator on the `name` property indicates that the `name` property should only appear in operation responses, not in operations that allow you to change properties of the `Widget` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We use `@doc` decorators on the model type and all properties for description. Documentation strings are enforced by linting rule when authoring specs with `Azure.Core`!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow that we have a resource type, the next step is to define operations for this resource.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Data types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-data-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `Read` {#Read}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `Read` {#Read}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA copy of the input model `T` with only the properties that are visible during the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Read\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" resource lifecycle phase.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Read\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" lifecycle phase is used for properties returned by operations that read data, like\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHTTP GET operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis transformation is recursive, and will include only properties that have the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`Lifecycle.Read` visibility modifier.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a `NameTemplate` is provided, the new model will be named according to the template.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe template uses the same syntax as the `@friendlyName` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Read\\\\\\\\u003cT, NameTemplate\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Template Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| T | The model to transform. |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| NameTemplate | The name template to use for the new model.\\\\\\\\u003cbr /\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\u003cbr /\\\\\\\\u003e* |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Update)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  secretName: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// This model has the `id` and `name` fields, but not `secretName`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ReadDog is Read\\\\\\\\u003cDog\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNone\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#visibility.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Visibility\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/visibility\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Visibility\\\\\\\\n## Lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#visibility.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a built-in visibility called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"resource lifecycle visibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This visibility allows you to declare\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nwhether properties are visible when passing a resource to or reading a resource from an API endpoint.

This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `POST` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read`: The property is visible when the resource is read. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  returned in an HTTP `GET` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update`: The property is visible when the resource is updated. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `PATCH` or `PUT` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete`: The property is visible when a resource is deleted. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `DELETE` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query`: The property is visible when a resource is passed as a parameter in a query. This visibility is checked, for\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  example, when a property is a parameter in an HTTP `GET` operation (**this should not be confused with an HTTP query\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameter defined using `@query`**).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Lifecycle visibility transforms\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can explicitly compute the shape of a model within a _specific_ lifecycle phase by using the four built-in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntemplates for lifecycle transforms:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Create\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Create` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Read` lifecycle phase,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Update` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, with the types of the properties set to `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have _either_ the `Create` or `Update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  visibility modifiers enabled, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Delete` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Query` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Update)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ReadExample is Read\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateExample is Create\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel UpdateExample is Update\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateOrUpdateExample is CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you use these templates, the resulting models have no `Lifecycle` visibility modifiers applied, so that any\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemitters or libraries that use lifecycle visibility will not alter them further.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `@withDefaultKeyVisibility` {#@withDefaultKeyVisibility}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@withDefaultKeyVisibility` {#@withDefaultKeyVisibility}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet the visibility of key properties in a model if not already set.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis will set the visibility modifiers of all key properties in the model if the visibility is not already _explicitly_ set,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbut will not change the visibility of any properties that have visibility set _explicitly_, even if the visibility\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nis the same as the default visibility.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nVisibility may be set explicitly using any of the following decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@visibility`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@removeVisibility`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@invisible`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@withDefaultKeyVisibility(visibility: valueof EnumMember)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Target\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`Model`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Type | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| visibility | `valueof EnumMember` | The desired default visibility value.

Here are some key points to consider:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Metadata is data about the data being transmitted. It can include information like the data's origin, when it was created or last updated, who created or updated it, and so on. Metadata is not usually visible to the end user, but it can be crucial for the system processing the data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility determines what data is visible to the end user or the system at any given time. For example, some data might be visible only to the system, some only to the end user, and some to both. Visibility can change depending on the context, such as whether the data is being created, read, updated, or deleted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `getRequestVisibility(HttpVerb): Visibility` API is used to determine the visibility implied for data in the request parameters or body. Note that `Visibility.Read` is always applied for response data, so there is no corresponding API for the response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo` API is used to create a metadata object for each program, which can then be used to reason about metadata and visibility implications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.getEffectivePayloadType(Type, Visibility): Type` API is used recursively on every type that is referenced. It recovers the named model when given an anonymous model sourced entirely from a single named model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)` API is used to check if a type undergoes any changes in shape due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nnamed model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)` API is used to check if a type undergoes any changes in shape due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isOptional(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to determine if a property is optional for the given visibility. This will differ from `ModelProperty.isOptional` when the Visibility is Update, in which case the property is always considered optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `Visibility.Item` flag is added when recursing into an array. This moves all metadata into the payload, which can be useful in scenarios like batching API calls.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBy understanding and correctly using these APIs and concepts, you can ensure that your emitter handles metadata and visibility consistently and effectively.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#reference#typekits.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"[API] Typekits\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/reference/typekits\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# [API] Typekits\\\\\\\\n## model\\\\\\\\n### getEffectiveModel\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#reference#typekits.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# [API] Typekits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## model\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### getEffectiveModel\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`ts\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * If the input is anonymous (or the provided filter removes properties) and there exists a named model with the same set of properties (ignoring filtered properties), then return that named model.

The system is backwards-compatible with visibility strings, but you should use enum-based visibility for\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnew specifications. String-based visibility (e.g. `@visibility(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"create\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")`) may be deprecated and removed in future\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nversions of TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Basic concepts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Visibility applies to _model properties_ only. It is used to determine when an emitter should include or exclude a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  property in a certain context.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility is defined using a _visibility class_. A visibility class is an `enum` that defines the visibility modifiers\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  (or flags) that can be applied to a property. Any `enum` can serve as a visibility class.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility classes have a _default_ visibility, which is the set of visibility modifiers that are applied _by default_\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  to a property if the visibility is not explicitly set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a built-in visibility called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"resource lifecycle visibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This visibility allows you to declare\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nwhether properties are visible when passing a resource to or reading a resource from an API endpoint. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The unique identifier of this resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   *\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The ID is automatically generated by the service, so it cannot be set when the resource is created or updated,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * but the server will return it when the resource is read.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The name of this resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   *\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The name can be set when the resource is created, but may not be changed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The description of this resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   *\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * By default, properties are visible in all lifecycle phases, so this property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * is present in all lifecycle phases.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, each property of the `Example` model has a lifecycle visibility that instructs emitters to include\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nor exclude the property when creating, updating, or reading the `Example` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec's HTTP library, OpenAPI emitter, and other standard functionality use the `Lifecycle` visibility to create\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ndifferent views of the `Example` model based on which lifecycle phase is used in a particular operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the following example, the type of the input and output of each operation is affected by the lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nof the properties in the `Example` model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/example\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Examples {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * When an operation uses the POST verb, it uses the `Create` lifecycle visibility to determine which properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * are visible.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @post create(@body example: Example): Created\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * When an operation uses the GET verb, it uses the `Read` lifecycle visibility to determine which properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * are visible.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nby the lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nof the properties in the `Example` model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/example\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Examples {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * When an operation uses the POST verb, it uses the `Create` lifecycle visibility to determine which properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * are visible.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @post create(@body example: Example): Created\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * When an operation uses the GET verb, it uses the `Read` lifecycle visibility to determine which properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * are visible.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @get read(@path id: string): Ok\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * When an operation uses the PATCH verb, it uses the `Update` lifecycle visibility to determine which properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * are visible.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @patch update(@path id: string, @body example: Example): Ok\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe above interface generates the following OpenAPIv3 schemas:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\npaths:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    post:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      parameters: []\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      responses:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          content:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n            application/json:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n              schema:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n                $ref: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#/components/schemas/Example\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      requestBody:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        required: true\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        content:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          application/json:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n            schema:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n              $ref: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#/components/schemas/Example\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /example/{id}:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    get:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      parameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        -

This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `POST` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read`: The property is visible when the resource is read. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  returned in an HTTP `GET` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update`: The property is visible when the resource is updated. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `PATCH` or `PUT` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete`: The property is visible when a resource is deleted. This visibility is checked, for example, when a property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  is a parameter in an HTTP `DELETE` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query`: The property is visible when a resource is passed as a parameter in a query. This visibility is checked, for\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  example, when a property is a parameter in an HTTP `GET` operation (**this should not be confused with an HTTP query\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameter defined using `@query`**).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Lifecycle visibility transforms\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can explicitly compute the shape of a model within a _specific_ lifecycle phase by using the four built-in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntemplates for lifecycle transforms:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Create\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Create` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Read` lifecycle phase,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Update` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, with the types of the properties set to `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have _either_ the `Create` or `Update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  visibility modifiers enabled, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Delete` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Query` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Update)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ReadExample is Read\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateExample is Create\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel UpdateExample is Update\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateOrUpdateExample is CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you use these templates, the resulting models have no `Lifecycle` visibility modifiers applied, so that any\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemitters or libraries that use lifecycle visibility will not alter them further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Visibility modifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach property has its own set of _active visibility modifiers_ for each visibility class. The active modifiers can be\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nchanged using the decorators described in this section.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Note**: Changing the visibility for one visibility class _does not_ affect other visibility classes. If you change the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nvisibility for the `Lifecycle` visibility class, it will not affect the modifiers that are active for _any_ other\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nvisibility cla\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#http#operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/http/operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Operations\\\\\\\\n## Automatic visibility\\\\\\\\n# libraries#http#operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Automatic visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `@typespec/rest` library understands [Lifecycle Visibility](../../language-basics/visibility.md#lifecycle-visibility) and provides functionality for emitters to apply visibility transforms based on whether a model represents a request or response and on HTTP method usage as detailed in the table below.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSee [handling visibility and metadata](../../extending-typespec/emitter-metadata-handling.md) for details on how to incorporate this information into an emitter implementation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Modifier         | Visible in           |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ---------------- | -------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Read   | Any response         |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Query  | GET or HEAD request  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Create | POST or PUT request  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Update | PATCH or PUT request |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Delete | DELETE request       |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis allows a single logical TypeSpec model to be used as in the following example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel User {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create) password: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Users {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @post create(@path id: string, ...User): User;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @get get(@path id: string): User;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere is a single logical user entity represented by the single TypeSpec type `User`, but the HTTP payload for this entity varies based on context.

By default, properties are included in the response if they have Lifecycle.Read visibility, and all properties have all visibilities enabled unless you restrict them with @visibility.\\\\nTherefore, unless you have properties with more restrictive visibilities, all properties will be included in the response by default. If you want to limit which properties are returned, you should annotate those properties with @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) or other appropriate modifiers, but you do not need to explicitly use a visibilityFilter just because a model is a response type.\\\\nIf you use the built-in Lifecycle visibility model as intended, the behavior you expect is implicit and handled automatically for response models.\\\"}\"}]",

            "answer": "1. **Model Validation Error (Additional properties not allowed):**\n\nThe error about additional properties (groupIds, privateLinkServiceConnectionState, privateEndpoint, provisioningState) not being allowed typically occurs when the resource model does not correctly inherit from the expected common-types resource. For PrivateEndpointConnection, you should use the Azure Resource Manager template provided in the TypeSpec Azure libraries, specifically `Azure.ResourceManager.PrivateEndpointConnectionResource` or `Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnection`.\n\nYou do **not** need to rename the model when leveraging from common-types. The name of the resource type (e.g., `PrivateEndpointConnection`) does not affect the API contract as long as the model structure matches the expected shape. Some RPs rename for clarity, but it is not required. The reviewer may provide guidance, but using the common-types model directly is the recommended approach.\n\nTo resolve the validation error, ensure your TypeSpec model is structured like this:\n\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\";\n\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnectionParameter, Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnection {}\n```\nOr, if you need to add parameters:\n```typespec\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnection {\n  ...Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnectionParameter;\n}\n```\nThis ensures the model includes the required properties and matches the common-types definition, which will resolve the additional properties error.\n\n2. **Avocado Error (API removal):**\n\nAvocado reports errors when an API is removed (e.g., `revokeCertificate` replaced by `revokeCertificates`). If you do not need to support the older preview API, you can remove it entirely. If you must keep the older API for backward compatibility, you should suppress the Avocado error. See the suppression guide: https://aka.ms/ci-fix and https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-Avocado#known-issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- You can retain the same resource name as in common-types; renaming is optional and not required for validation.\n- Fix the model validation by ensuring your TypeSpec model correctly extends or composes the common-types resource.\n- For Avocado errors due to API removal, either remove the old API if not needed or suppress the error if backward compatibility is required.",

Add or update 'examples' files for each operation of your OpenAPI file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   The [oav](https://github.com/Azure/oav) provides two ways to generate OpenAPI examples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set. Since the auto-generated\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     examples consist of random values for most types, you need replace them with meaningful values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       oav generate-examples openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Note, latest OAV tool should automatically generate the following. However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     please ensure you have:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `operationId`. This is used to match with declared operations in TypeSpec and correctly output in OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Add/update the `readme.md` file in the `{service}` folder to specify the version and location of the OpenAPI files. The `readme.md` is needed for both management-plane and data-plane services for REST API Docs generation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   Example:[sample-readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/widget/resource-manager/Microsoft.Widget/Widget/readme.md)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n5.

For PrivateEndpointConnection, you should use the Azure Resource Manager template provided in the TypeSpec Azure libraries, specifically `Azure.ResourceManager.PrivateEndpointConnectionResource` or `Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnection`.\\\\n\\\\nYou do **not** need to rename the model when leveraging from common-types. The name of the resource type (e.g., `PrivateEndpointConnection`) does not affect the API contract as long as the model structure matches the expected shape. Some RPs rename for clarity, but it is not required. The reviewer may provide guidance, but using the common-types model directly is the recommended approach.\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve the validation error, ensure your TypeSpec model is structured like this:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nimport \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnectionParameter, Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnection {}\\\\n```\\\\nOr, if you need to add parameters:\\\\n```typespec\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnection {\\\\n  ...Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.PrivateEndpointConnectionParameter;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis ensures the model includes the required properties and matches the common-types definition, which will resolve the additional properties error.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Avocado Error (API removal):**\\\\n\\\\nAvocado reports errors when an API is removed (e.g., `revokeCertificate` replaced by `revokeCertificates`). If you do not need to support the older preview API, you can remove it entirely. If you must keep the older API for backward compatibility, you should suppress the Avocado error. See the suppression guide: https://aka.ms/ci-fix and https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-Avocado#known-issues.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- You can retain the same resource name as in common-types; renaming is optional and not required for validation.\\\\n- Fix the model validation by ensuring your TypeSpec model correctly extends or composes the common-types resource.\\\\n- For Avocado errors due to API removal, either remove the old API if not needed or suppress the error if backward compatibility is required.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Looking at your PR, it seems that the avocado error is the only remaining one - this is just reporting that you have removed an API.  If you do not need to continue supporting the older preview, you might consider removing it,  otherwise, this is an error you can safely suppress (https://aka.ms/ci-fix is a great link to remember, as it has links to all kinds of useful info about ci errors, including a link to the suppression guides).\\\\nFor PrivateEndpointConnections, RPs have done both, as the name of the private endpoint connection type doesn't really matter to the API, however, there is a new template that greatly simplifies adding private endpoint connection operations to any resourc,e see:\\\\n[typespec-azure/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-end\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/blob/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-endpoints.tsp#L69-L94)\\\\n```\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointConnectionResource;\\\\nalias PrivateEndpointOperations = PrivateEndpoints<PrivateEndpointConnection>;\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\nget is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;\\\\ncreateOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;\\\\nupdate is ArmCustomPatchSync<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nAzure.ResourceManager.Foundations.ResourceUpdateModel<Employee, EmployeeProperties>\\\\n>;\\\\ndelete is ArmResourceDeleteSync<Employee>;\\\\nlistByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;\\\\nlistBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;\\\\n/** A sample resource action that move employee to different location */\\\\nmove is ArmResourceActionSync<Employee, MoveRequest, MoveResponse>;\\\\n/** A sample HEAD operation to check resource existence */\\\\ncheckExistence is ArmResourceCheckExistence<Employee>;\\\\ngetPrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.Read<Employee>;\\\\ncreateOrUpdatePrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.CreateOrUpdateAsync<Employee>;\\\\nupdatePrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.CustomPatchAsync<Employee>;\\\\ndeletePrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.DeleteAsync<Employee>;\\\\nlistPrivateEndpointConnections is PrivateEndpointOperations.ListByParent<Employee>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nSee here for the Avocado error.

            "answer": "To implement an update (PATCH) operation for a Host resource with a discriminator in TypeSpec, you should use the standard ARM PATCH operation templates, but you must ensure that your resource's update model correctly includes the discriminator property as required. The OBJECT_MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY_DEFINITION error from oav typically means the PATCH request body (the update model) is missing a required property\u2014often the discriminator itself.\n\nIn TypeSpec, discriminators are defined using the @discriminator decorator on a model, and the property (e.g., 'kind' or 'type') must be present and required in all derived models. For PATCH operations, the update model must include the discriminator property so that clients and validation tools (like oav) can correctly identify the type being updated.\n\nHere's how you should structure your resource and PATCH operation:\n\n```typespec\n@discriminator(\"kind\")\nmodel Host {\n  kind: HostKind;\n  // other properties\n}\n\nunion HostKind {\n  string,\n  Windows: \"windows\",\n  Linux: \"linux\"\n}\n\nmodel WindowsHost extends Host {\n  kind: HostKind.Windows;\n  // windows-specific properties\n}\n\nmodel LinuxHost extends Host {\n  kind: HostKind.Linux;\n  // linux-specific properties\n}\n\n// The PATCH update model must include the discriminator\nmodel HostUpdate {\n  kind?: HostKind; // Optional for PATCH, but must be present if updating type\n  // other updatable properties\n}\n\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Hosts {\n  update is ArmCustomPatchAsync<Host, HostUpdate>;\n}\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Use ArmCustomPatchAsync (or ArmCustomPatchSync for synchronous) and provide a custom update model that includes the discriminator property.\n- The update model should allow the discriminator property to be present (optional for PATCH, but required if switching types).\n- Ensure the discriminator property is defined in the update model so oav can validate the PATCH body correctly.\n\nIf you use ArmResourcePatchAsync directly with a resource that has a discriminator, the generated update model may not include the discriminator property, causing oav to fail. By explicitly defining a custom update model (as above), you resolve this issue and comply with ARM and TypeSpec best practices.",

A _null_ value will not erase the property, but set it back to its default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Model` and `Record` typed properties, when present in a Patch request are merged with the existing resource value in accordance with the merge-patch algorithm: this transformation is recursively applied to these values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Array` typed properties, when present in a Patch request replace the existing resource value in accordance with the merge-patch algorithm. This transformation is _not_ recursively applied to these values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Properties required to deserialize a request (for example, discriminators) are _required_ in a Patch request body.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_migration_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec-migration-docs-2025-09-12.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"rename duplicated model `Resource`\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# rename duplicated model `Resource`\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec-migration-docs-2025-09-12.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# rename duplicated model `Resource`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhow to rename duplicated model `Resource` for python?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdd in specification/keyvault/Keyvault.Management/back-compatible.tsp:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```diff\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+ import \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+ @@clientName(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Resource, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ArmResource\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#azure-resource-manager#reference#interfaces.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Interfaces and Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-resource-manager/reference/interfaces\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Interfaces and Operations\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ResourceManager\\\\\\\\n### `ArmResourcePatchSync` {#Azure.ResourceManager.ArmResourcePatchSync}\\\\\\\\n# libraries#azure-resource-manager#reference#interfaces.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Interfaces and Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ResourceManager\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `ArmResourcePatchSync` {#Azure.ResourceManager.ArmResourcePatchSync}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop Azure.ResourceManager.ArmResourcePatchSync(provider: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.ThisWillBeReplaced\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", properties: Resource): Azure.ResourceManager.ArmResponse\\\\\\\\u003cResponseBody\\\\\\\\u003e | Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.ErrorResponse\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Template Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name           | Description                                               |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Resource       | the resource being patched                                |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Properties     | The model type of the resource properties                 |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| BaseParameters | Optional.

All `Required` rules are enforced using automated linter rules and **must** be adhered to. Violating these rules results in **errors** to be flagged by the automated checks and blocks the OpenAPI spec PRs from getting approved.

The templates\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nrecursively apply the merge-patch transformation rules to a TypeSpec resource Model, taking\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninto account the structure and characteristics of the resource Model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example, given a resource model like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Resource {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  quantity?: safeint;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  color: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"green\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"red\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  flavor?: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"vanilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"chocolate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"strawberry\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"vanilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  related?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cResource\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  tags?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA JSON Merge-Patch request updating this resource would have the following behavior:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `id` may or may not occur in the request, if it does occur, the resource value can be updated to a new string, but cannot be erased by sending null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `name` may or may not occur in the request, if it does occur, the resource value can be updated to a new string or erased by sending null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `quantity` may or ay not occur in the request, if it does occur, the resource value can be updated to a new integer value or erased by sending null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `color` may or may not occur in the request, if it does occur, the resource value can be updated to one of the appropriate values. If set to `null` it is returned to its default value (`blue`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `flavor` may or may not occur in the request, if it does occur, the resource value can be updated to one of the appropriate values. If set to `null` it is returned to its default value (`vanilla`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `related` may or may not occur in the request, if it does occur, the resource value can be updated or erased (set to `{}`) by sending null.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### The MergePatch Transform\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGeneralizing these rules creates a type transform of the resource Model into a Model defining the corresponding Patch request body. The properties of a resource define the allowed properties and their types in a Patch request body for that resource as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `type` of a property indicates the allowed type of the corresponding property in a Patch request.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Required` properties without a default value are _optional_ in a Patch request, but if present, the value cannot be null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Optional` properties are _optional_ in a Patch request, and, if present, can contain any valid value or null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Properties with a default value are _optional_ in a Patch request, but have no default value in the request body. If present, they can contain any valid value or null. A _null_ value will not erase the property, but set it back to its default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Model` and `Record` typed properties, when present in a Patch request are merged with the existing resource value in accordance with the merge-patch algorithm: this transformation is recursively applied to these values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Array` typed properties, when present in a Patch request replace the existing resource value in accordance with the merge-patch algorithm. This transformation is _not_ recursively applied to these values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Properties required to deserialize a request (for example, discriminators) are _required_ in a Patch request body.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Constraints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause JSON merge-patch only describes the request body of an http request, the merge-patch\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntransform in TypeSpec does not allow http envelope property metadata like `@query`, `@path`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@header`, `@cookie`, and `@statusCode` in http requests.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe merge-patch templates will **emit an error diagnostic** if a model containing Http metadata\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nproperties is passed in. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ResourceWithMetadata {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @header eTag: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// THIS WILL RESULT IN AN ERROR\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@patch op update(...MergePatchUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cResourceWithMetadata\\\\\\\\u003e): ResourceWithMetadata;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Patch Behavior of Nested Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModel types may be nested beneath the top level of a resource. The characteristics of the ModelProperty that references a nested Model type determines the valid values for that nested model in the Patch request. Here is how the valid values are determined for each of the model property types that might reference a nested model (also depicted in the following tables):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The property type is a (simple) Model or an intersection of models\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - if the property is optional, the MergePatch transform applies, and the visibility is `CreateOrUpdate`. This is because, in an update, the property _may or may not_ exist if the resource exists, so might need to be created or updated.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - if the property is required, the MergePatch transform applies and the visibility matches the input visibility. This is because, in an update, the property _must_ exist if the resource exists, so it can only be updated. In a CreateOrUpdate, it could also be created with the resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The property type is an array (sequence) of model type items\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - For required or optional arrays: The MergePatch transform _does not apply_ and the visibility is `Create`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The property type is a Record (keyed collection) of model type values\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - For required or optional keyed collections, the MergePatch transform applies, and the visibility is create or update.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The property type is a union of model type values\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - The MergePatch transform applies to each of the union variants, and because switching between variants is possible, CreateOrUpdate visibility is applied regardless of the optionality of the property. If the union is discriminated, the discriminator remains 'required' so the service can understand which variant the request was intended to apply to.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Treatment of Nested Keyed Types in Patch Request with `Update` Visibility Filter\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Property Type | Optionality | Example                      | Apply MergePatch transform? | Visibility Filter |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Simple        | Required    | `fooProp: Foo`               | Yes                         | `Update`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Simple        | Optional    | `fooProp?: Foo`              | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ReplaceOnly   | Required    | `@replaceOnly fooProp: Foo`  | No                          | `Create`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ReplaceOnly   | Optional    | `@replaceOnly fooProp?: Foo` | No                          | `Create`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Array         | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*          | `fooProp?: Foo[]`            | No                          | `Create`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Record        | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*          | `fooProp?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cFoo\\\\\\\\u003e`      | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Union         | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*          | `fooProp?: Foo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| Bar`       | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Treatment of Nested Keyed Types in Patch Request with `CreateOrUpdate` Visibility Filter\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Property Type | Optionality | Example                      | Apply MergePatch transform? | Visibility Filter |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Simple        | Required    | `fooProp: Foo`               | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Simple        | Optional    | `fooProp?: Foo`              | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ReplaceOnly   | Required    | `@replaceOnly fooProp: Foo`  | No                          | `Create`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ReplaceOnly   | Optional    | `@replaceOnly fooProp?: Foo` | No                          | `Create`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Array         | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*          | `fooProp?: Foo[]`            | No                          | `Create`          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Record        | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*          | `fooProp?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cFoo\\\\\\\\u003e`      | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Union         | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*          | `fooProp?: Foo \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| Bar`       | Yes                         | `CreateOrUpdate`  |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Update\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA JSON Merge Patch update operation for a Widget resource using `@body`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// A Json merge-patch operation to update a 'Widget' resource\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// and return the updated Widget.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@patch op update(@body request: MergePatchUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA JSON Merge Patch update operation for a Widget resource using the spread operator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// A Json merge-patch operation to update a 'Widget' resource\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// and return the updated Widget.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@patch op update(...MergePatchUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Create or Update\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA JSON Merge Patch create or update operation for a Widget resource using `@body`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// A Json merge-patch operation to update a 'Widget' resource\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// or create it if it does not exist and return the updated Widget.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@patch op update(@body request: MergePatchCreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA JSON Merge Patch create or update operation for a Widget resource using the sp\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM-Operations-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec ARM Operation Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec ARM Operation Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 1.

The OBJECT_MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY_DEFINITION error from oav typically means the PATCH request body (the update model) is missing a required property\\\\u2014often the discriminator itself.\\\\n\\\\nIn TypeSpec, discriminators are defined using the @discriminator decorator on a model, and the property (e.g., 'kind' or 'type') must be present and required in all derived models.

LintDiff runs on your specification both before and after your PR. If the 'before' state (main branch) is already crashing due to missing or misconfigured input files, then your PR to fix it will still result in a crash for the CI check. This is not a bug in your PR, but rather a limitation of how LintDiff operates: it requires valid input files in both the base and PR branches. To resolve this, ensure that the main branch is fixed first, or coordinate with repo maintainers to unblock your PR. If you are certain your input-file paths are correct and present, this error is not caused by your changes but by the state of the main branch.",

Add or update 'examples' files for each operation of your OpenAPI file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   The [oav](https://github.com/Azure/oav) provides two ways to generate OpenAPI examples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set. Since the auto-generated\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     examples consist of random values for most types, you need replace them with meaningful values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       oav generate-examples openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Note, latest OAV tool should automatically generate the following. However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     please ensure you have:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `operationId`. This is used to match with declared operations in TypeSpec and correctly output in OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Add/update the `readme.md` file in the `{service}` folder to specify the version and location of the OpenAPI files. The `readme.md` is needed for both management-plane and data-plane services for REST API Docs generation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   Example:[sample-readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/widget/resource-manager/Microsoft.Widget/Widget/readme.md)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n5.

You will need to suppress both the TypeSpec violation (in TypeSpec source code) and the LintDiff violations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAnonymousParameter`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### data-plane\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData-plane specs can suppress violations of this rule, since it only exists for the benefit of SDKs generated from swagger, and data-plane SDKs are generated directly from TypeSpec.  Resource-manager specs should **not** suppress violations of this rule, since resource-manager SDKs are generated from OpenAPI, and rely on these errors being fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### resource-manager\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs an exception to the previous note, resource-manager specs **may** be able to suppress `AvoidAnonymousTypes`, but only if the error is inside a 202 response from a long-running operation (LRO).  It is known that SDKs do not need to generate type names for such responses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAnonymousTypes`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData-plane specs can suppress violations of this rule, since it only exists for the benefit of SDKs generated from swagger, and data-plane SDKs are generated directly from TypeSpec.  Resource-manager specs should **not** suppress violations of this rule, since resource-manager SDKs are generated from OpenAPI, and rely on these errors being fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `LongRunningResourceAction`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a known issue where `LongRunningResourceAction` in TypeSpec, generates swagger that causes `AvoidAnonymousTypes`.  These errors should be suppressed until the root cause is fixed.  https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure-pr/issues/3349\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `EvenSegmentedPathForPutOperation`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `EvenSegmentedPathForPutOperation` is failing for OpenAPI generated from TypeSpec using `@singleton` (OpenAPI path ends with `/default`), we believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/646\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `IntegerTypeMustHaveFormat`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData-plane specs can suppress violations of this rule, since it only exists for the benefit of SDKs generated from swagger, and data-plane SDKs are generated directly from TypeSpec.  Resource-manager specs should **not** suppress violations of this rule, since resource-manager SDKs are generated from OpenAPI, and rely on these errors being fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `PatchBodyParameterSchema`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe root cause is a bug in typespec-azure:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/issues/383.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPlease see the issue above for the suggested workaround and apply it directly to the spec TypeSpec sources.  The LintDiff error should **not** be ignored or suppressed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `PatchPropertiesCorrespondToPutProperties`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/642\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe use of `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e` in TypeSpec is discouraged, and there is a TypeSpec lint rule to enforce this.  If you still need to use `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e`, the OpenAPI spec generated will cause many LintDiff errors of types `AvoidAdditionalProperties` and `PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition`.  You will need to suppress both the TypeSpec violation (in TypeSpec source code) and the LintDiff violations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe root cause is a limitation in how `azure-openapi-validator` and `oav` handle `$ref` siblings:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/637\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- https://github.com/Azure/oav/issues/848\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe recommended workaround is to add `use-read-only-status-schema: true` to your `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `RequestBodyMustExistForPutPatch`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/641\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `ResourceNameRestriction`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether `ResourceNameRestriction` should be applied to enums is an open question:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/501\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/pull/714\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUntil this is resolved, suppress the errors and discuss with your ARM reviewer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `XmsEnumValidation`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec using `OAuth2Auth` may generate the following OpenAPI:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OAuth2 authentication\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"enum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"oauth2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n},\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhich causes error `XmsEnumValidation`.  The recommended workaround is to add `omit-unreachable-types: true` to your `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `XmsPageableForListCalls`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `XmsPageableForListCalls` are failing for OpenAPI generated from TypeSpec using `@singleton` (OpenAPI path ends with `/default`), we believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/646\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"bad\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# bad\\\\\\\\n## Troubleshooting AutoRest suppressions not working\\\\\\\\n### For suppression path, use exactly the element the error is pointing to\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# bad\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Troubleshooting AutoRest suppressions not working\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### For suppression path, use exactly the element the error is pointing to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe path in the suppression you add must point to exactly the same element as pointed out by the error.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example, if the failure link points [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/30be453a97b9a4d64b1a7a6e45d7364bfbf4d8a2/specification/subscription/resource-manager/Microsoft.Subscription/stable/2021-10-01/subscriptions.json#L137),\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nthen the path should be:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` xpath\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n$.paths[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/providers/Microsoft.Subscription/subscriptionOperations/{operationId}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"].get.responses[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"202\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [Example path for suppressing LintDiff code `GetOperation200`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/24395/commits/41f8f34937be245a855ff49552ecdeb0213ca525)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - **IMPORTANT**: This example uses the legacy `directive/suppress` syntax.

SDK generation configuration\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#api-spec-gen-sdk-config.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# SDK generation configuration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo generate SDK code based on REST API specifications, you need to configure the corresponding files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For TypeSpec, the configuration file is `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For OpenAPI, the configuration file is `readme.md`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Enable SDK generation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e[!IMPORTANT]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e You cannot enable SDK generation for both TypeSpec and OpenAPI simultaneously. Disable one before enabling the other.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### [TypeSpec](#tab/typespec)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdd the specific SDK language emitter settings to `tspconfig.yaml`. For example, to generate CSharp SDK code from your TypeSpecs:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Add `@azure-typespec/http-client-csharp-mgmt` to the `options` settings in `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Refer to the 'ContosoWidgetManager' samples to set the default values for each SDK language emitter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - For management plane TypeSpecs, refer to [Contoso.Management tspconfig.yaml](https://aka.ms/azsdk/tspconfig-sample-mpg).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - For data plane TypeSpecs, refer to [Contoso.WidgetManager tspconfig.yaml](https://aka.ms/azsdk/tspconfig-sample-dpg).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-typespec/http-client-csharp-mgmt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    namespace: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Azure.ResourceManager.Contoso\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    emitter-output-dir: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{output-dir}/{service-dir}/{namespace}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### [OpenAPI](#tab/openapi)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigure the `swagger-to-sdk` section in `readme.md`. For example, to generate CSharp SDK code for your OpenAPIs:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Add `azure-sdk-for-net` to the list.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Add detailed settings to a separate file `readme.csharp.md` and place it in the same folder as `readme.md`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Swagger to SDK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is not used by Autorest itself.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n$(swagger-to-sdk)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nswagger-to-sdk:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## CSharp\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee configuration in [readme.csharp.md](./readme.csharp.md)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor more samples on configuring specific `readme.{language}.md`, refer to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [Sample Readmes for Management Plane Specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/documentation/samplefiles)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [Sample Readmes for Data Plane Specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/documentation/samplefiles-dp)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [Config SDK Guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/documentation/code-gen)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Configuration\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/configuration/configuration\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Configuration\\\\\\\\n# handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Configuration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nimport { FileTree } from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@astrojs/starlight/components\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec compiler and libraries can be configured either via a configuration-file or command line flags.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration can be provided via the `tspconfig.yaml` configuration file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec compiler will look for the closest `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the same directory or closest parent directory from the TypeSpec entrypoint.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example if running `tsp compile /dev/foo/bar/main.tsp`, the compiler will lookup the file at the folllowing paths (in order):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/bar/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Schema\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe file is a `yaml` document with the following structure.

If the same property exists in both files, the extending file's value completely replaces the extended file's value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Options merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `options` property receives special treatment with a one-level deep merge:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Different emitters from both files are combined\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- If the same emitter is configured in both files, the extending file's emitter configuration completely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ncompletely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:   # Completely replaces emitter1 options\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-c: value-c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter3:   # Added alongside emitter2 from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-y: value-y\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Resulting merged config:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// emit: [emitter3]  # Only emitter3, emitter1 is gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// options:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter1: { option-c: value-c }  # Only option-c, option-a and option-b are gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter2: { option-x: value-x }  # Inherited from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter3: { option-y: value-y }  # From extending config\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Variable interpolation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec project file provides variable interpolation using:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- config file parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- emitter options can reference each other\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nVariable interpolation is done using an variable expression surrounded by `{` and `}`.

CLI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nParameters can be organized in a nested structure, to access different levels of the structure, use dots (`.`) in the variable expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTherefore, parameter names should not contain `.` in their name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be utilized in the default value of these parameters.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese parameters can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll parameters must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  base-dir:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {base-dir}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe parameter can then be specified via `--arg` in this format `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` and for nested structures `--arg

variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can specify which environment variables it can interpolate.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be used in the default value of these environment variables.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese environment variables can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression, using the `env.` prefix.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll environment variables must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenvironment-variables:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  BASE_DIR:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {env.BASE_DIR}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Emitter Options\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCertain emitter configurations can be interpolated using a specific rule designed to collapse a path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a variable is succeeded by a `/` or `.` and the emitter responsible for interpolating the config doesn't supply that variable, the path segment will be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, consider the following config value: `{service-name}/output.{version}.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's what would be produced:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Service name value | Version value | Result                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`        | `PetStore/output.v1.json` |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       |

The interesting thing is, the place I'm violating the rules, its swagger is the same as before. Why these violations are not reported before?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe LintDiff errors in your PR are not necessarily new violations. Many of them already existed in the main branch, but previously, CI failures weren\\\\u2019t blocking, so these issues were effectively allowed to persist unnoticed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, because your PR is part of a TypeSpec (TSP) migration, the generated Swagger includes many differences\\\\u2014over 3,000 diffs in total\\\\u2014due to normalization by the AutoRest emitter. These changes are functionally equivalent but not textually identical, which makes it hard for the LintDiff auto-baselining algorithm to recognize unchanged areas. As a result, you\\\\u2019re seeing errors flagged as new, even if the same issues existed in main.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGiven the unreliability of the auto-baselining mechanism, we recommend not depending on it. Instead, all LintDiff errors\\\\u2014regardless of whether they are newly introduced or pre-existing\\\\u2014should be explicitly suppressed in the `readme.md` file. This is the mitigation approach we advise for all PRs, especially TSP migrations.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Typespec Validation required check\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Typespec Validation required check\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Typespec Validation required check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/{module-name}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" does not match \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/{service-dir}/{package-dir}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

Specifically, patterns like {width}x{height} or {x}/{y}@{scale}x in your API paths are now breaking validation due to stricter parsing rules introduced in path-to-regexp@6.2.1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPreviously, your spec passed validation because older versions of path-to-regexp were more lenient. The recent update introduced security fixes that inadvertently caused this break.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo unblock your PR, we\\\\u2019ve deployed a temporary fix that pins path-to-regexp to an older version. This means your Swagger checks should no longer crash. Meanwhile, we\\\\u2019re working on a permanent solution that doesn\\\\u2019t rely on pinning old code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you still need to validate locally, you can manually install the older version and run oav like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cinstall node 20\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmkdir testdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncd testdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnpm i oav path-to-regexp@6.2.2\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnpx oav validate-example /path/to/your/openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, you can use validate-spec instead of validate-example if you're checking the spec directly. This workaround has been confirmed to pass for your PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ve also applied the approved-modelvalidation and approved-semanticvalidation labels to your PR to unblock progress. Just note that if other issues surface later due to this regression, you may need to address them in a follow-up PR.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_07_31.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Looking for examples on running TypeSpec in ADO Pipelines\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Looking for examples on running TypeSpec in ADO Pipelines\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_07_31.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Looking for examples on running TypeSpec in ADO Pipelines\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe're looking to work in ADO internally before promoting swagger to github - is there any examples of teams using the TypeSpec method for swagger internally vai ADO pipelines?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nhttps://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/rest-api-publish/buildpipelines/#_top\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbut this is only about typespec itself.

There is no strict requirement in the referenced documentation that all resource providers (including ring 0 services like Microsoft.Compute) must have their specs present in RPaaSMaster if they have received an explicit exemption from RPaaS onboarding. The documentation and FAQ state that if your service is not onboarded to RPaaS (and has an exception), you do not need to merge your specs into RPaaSMaster. The presence or absence of Microsoft.Compute in RPaaSMaster does not dictate requirements for other RPs; each spec owner is responsible for their own onboarding and branch sync according to their onboarding status and exemptions. If your ring 0 service has an approved exception, you can continue to manage your specs in 'main' and do not need to merge into RPaaSMaster unless instructed otherwise by the ARM or EngSys team.",

However, this is only a one-time suppression and should be done if:\nThere is an ongoing discussion and plan to resolve the uniform versioning issue for Compute.\nYou or your team are aware that this is a temporary measure and are working towards compliance.\nImportant: Regular use of this suppression is discouraged. The long-term solution is to restructure your API versions so all components under Compute adopt a uniform versioning scheme, or split into independent services as outlined in the Uniform Versioning Violation Guide.\nIf you are not aware of any ongoing discussion or plan for resolution, you should reach out to azversioning@service.microsoft.com for guidance.",

However, when you attempt to merge to the main branch, the Avocado check failure due to multiple API versions will become a blocker. The MULTIPLE_API_VERSION rule was upgraded to an error as of 7/1/2025 and is now a mandatory requirement for TypeSpec conversion across Azure services.\n\nTo resolve this, you should:\n1. Review the guidance at https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-Avocado#multiple_api_version and the Uniform Versioning Violation Guide.\n2. If you believe your service qualifies for a one-time suppression, contact azversioning@service.microsoft.com for approval.\n3. Do NOT rely on suppression as a long-term solution; you should work to resolve the underlying versioning issue to comply with Azure API guidelines and enable successful TypeSpec conversion.\n\nSuppression is only possible with explicit approval and should be used sparingly.

Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes.

The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.

            "answer": "API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\n\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\n\nThe correct and supported approach is:\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\n\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\n```\n\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\n\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation in tspconfig.yaml until you are ready to onboard SDKs.",

            "answer": "SDK generation is NOT required for private preview approval of an ARM (management-plane) API. For private preview, you are not required to onboard SDK emitters or provide SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. The Azure guidelines explicitly state that private preview versions do not have corresponding SDK package versions, and there are no SDK support requirements for private preview.\n\nHowever, the TypeSpec validation system (TSV) may expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, which can cause validation failures if you remove them. To resolve this, you should add a suppressions.yaml file in your service folder and suppress the specific validation rules related to missing SDK configuration. This is the recommended approach for private preview scenarios where SDK generation is not in scope.\n\nExample suppressions.yaml for disabling Go SDK validation (similar approach for other SDKs):\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  sub-rules:\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not required for private preview.'\n```\n\nYou can suppress other SDK emitter options in the same way if you encounter validation errors for them. This allows your TypeSpec to validate and pass CI without requiring SDK configuration until you are ready to onboard SDKs for public preview or GA.\n\nSummary:\n- Private preview does NOT require SDK generation or SDK config in tspconfig.yaml.\n- Suppress SDK validation rules in suppressions.yaml to pass TypeSpec validation.\n- You can onboard SDKs later when moving to public preview or GA.",

I've seen some tspconfig.yaml without sdk configs, but when i try removing them I encounter tsv failures.\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"SDK generation is NOT required for private preview approval of an ARM (management-plane) API. For private preview, you are not required to onboard SDK emitters or provide SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. The Azure guidelines explicitly state that private preview versions do not have corresponding SDK package versions, and there are no SDK support requirements for private preview.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the TypeSpec validation system (TSV) may expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, which can cause validation failures if you remove them. To resolve this, you should add a suppressions.yaml file in your service folder and suppress the specific validation rules related to missing SDK configuration. This is the recommended approach for private preview scenarios where SDK generation is not in scope.\\\\n\\\\nExample suppressions.yaml for disabling Go SDK validation (similar approach for other SDKs):\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  sub-rules:\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\\\\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not required for private preview.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can suppress other SDK emitter options in the same way if you encounter validation errors for them. This allows your TypeSpec to validate and pass CI without requiring SDK configuration until you are ready to onboard SDKs for public preview or GA.\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\n- Private preview does NOT require SDK generation or SDK config in tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n- Suppress SDK validation rules in suppressions.yaml to pass TypeSpec validation.\\\\n- You can onboard SDKs later when moving to public preview or GA.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\\\\n\\\\nThe correct and supported approach is:\\\\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\\\\n\\\\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation in tspconfig.yaml until you are ready to onboard SDKs.\\\"}\"}]",

If you want to assign a default value to a required field, you\\\\u2019ll need to use the \\\\u201cremove/rename dance\\\\u201d workaround, as shown in the referenced playground. This means you\\\\u2019ll have to remove the old field and reintroduce it with a default value, which is not ideal but currently the only way.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCan we delete unused preview versions and only keep the latest one?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYes, absolutely. That is what we recommend. Azure services are moving toward maintaining only one active preview version per spec (except for ARM retention requirements, which typically apply only to public previews). Since you\\\\u2019re still in private preview and none of your previous versions are being used, you can safely remove them and keep only the latest one.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDeprecation only matters if you have customers using those versions. For private previews, there are no SDK support requirements. You can simply remove the older versions from your TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s the process for moving to public preview?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou should open a PR against the public repo\\\\u2019s main branch before the public preview announcement. You can start preparing Microsoft Learn documentation using the versions merged in the RPSaaSMaster branch. The review process for public preview is slightly easier if you\\\\u2019ve already been reviewed privately, but it does include required SDK checks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou should only bring over the latest preview version to the public repo.

The question is about whether SDK generation/configuration is required for private preview ARM APIs and what to do about TypeSpec validation errors related to missing SDK config.  \\n2. The response states SDK generation is not required for private preview, referencing Azure guidelines that private preview versions do not have SDK packages or support requirements.  \\n3. It explains that TypeSpec validation may still expect SDK emitter options, and recommends suppressing those validation rules in suppressions.yaml, providing a concrete example.  \\n4.

For private preview, you are not required to onboard SDK emitters or provide SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. The Azure guidelines explicitly state that private preview versions do not have corresponding SDK package versions, and there are no SDK support requirements for private preview.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the TypeSpec validation system (TSV) may expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, which can cause validation failures if you remove them. To resolve this, you should add a suppressions.yaml file in your service folder and suppress the specific validation rules related to missing SDK configuration. This is the recommended approach for private preview scenarios where SDK generation is not in scope.\\\\n\\\\nExample suppressions.yaml for disabling Go SDK validation (similar approach for other SDKs):\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  sub-rules:\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\\\\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not required for private preview.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can suppress other SDK emitter options in the same way if you encounter validation errors for them. This allows your TypeSpec to validate and pass CI without requiring SDK configuration until you are ready to onboard SDKs for public preview or GA.\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\n- Private preview does NOT require SDK generation or SDK config in tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n- Suppress SDK validation rules in suppressions.yaml to pass TypeSpec validation.\\\\n- You can onboard SDKs later when moving to public preview or GA.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\\\\n\\\\nThe correct and supported approach is:\\\\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\\\\n\\\\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation in tspconfig.yaml until you are ready to onboard SDKs.\\\"}\"}]",

            "answer": "Your TypeSpec validation is failing because the CI system is enforcing the presence of Go SDK emitter configuration options in your tspconfig.yaml, even though your service does not require a Go SDK. This is due to the SdkTspConfigValidation rule, which checks for required emitter options for all supported SDKs.\n\nSince your service does not support or plan to support a Go SDK, you should suppress these specific validation checks. The recommended approach is to add a suppressions.yaml file in the root directory of your service specification (where tspconfig.yaml is located) and explicitly suppress the missing Go emitter options for TypeSpecValidation.\n\nHere is an example suppression file that will resolve your issue:\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  sub-rules:\n    # Suppress validation for Go emitter options\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\n  reason: 'Service does not support a Go SDK currently'\n```\n\nAdd this suppressions.yaml file to your repo, commit, and push. This will allow the CI validation to pass without requiring unnecessary Go SDK configuration. This approach is fully supported and documented in the Azure REST API specs wiki.\n\nIf you later decide to support a Go SDK, you should remove the suppression and add the required configuration options to tspconfig.yaml.",

            "answer": "You should NOT use @OpenAPI.extension(\"x-ms-identifiers\", #[]) in your Azure Resource Manager TypeSpec code. The no-openapi rule is strict: ARM specs must NOT use decorators from @typespec/openapi or @azure-tools/typespec-autorest, including $extension, because these are only processed by OpenAPI emitters and will break other emitters (like client SDKs).\nFor array properties, the correct approach is to use the @identifiers decorator from @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager. This decorator is the ARM-compliant way to specify identifying properties for array items and will ensure that x-ms-identifiers is emitted in the generated OpenAPI as needed, without violating the no-openapi rule. If there are no identifying properties, you can use @identifiers([]) to indicate this.\nExample:\n```\n@identifiers([])\nmyArrayField: MyItemType[];\n```\nIf you use @identifiers, the ARM linter will recognize the array is correctly specified and will not require you to use the OpenAPI extension directly.\nYou should only suppress the error if you have a legitimate, ARM-approved reason (for example, for backwards compatibility or an explicit reviewer exemption). But for new fields and normal scenarios, always use the ARM-compliant decorators, NOT OpenAPI extensions.\nSummary:\nDO NOT use @OpenAPI.extension(\"x-ms-identifiers\", #[]) in ARM specs.\nDO use @identifiers([]) or @identifiers([\"propertyName\"]) as appropriate for array items.\nSuppression should only be used in rare, reviewer-approved cases, not as a general workaround.\nThis approach ensures your spec is future-proof, passes all ARM validation, and is compliant with Azure API guidelines.",

This is explicitly prohibited by the Azure API guidelines and the @azure-tools/typespec-azure-core/no-openapi rule, because OpenAPI-specific decorators break compatibility with other emitters and are considered legacy.\n\nInstead, you must use the @identifiers decorator from the Azure Resource Manager TypeSpec library. This is the correct, supported way to specify identifying properties for array items in ARM specs. For example:\n\n```typespec\nmodel ResourceProperties {\n  @identifiers(#[\"propertyName1\", \"propertyName2\"])\n  array: ItemType[];\n}\n```\n\nIf your array items do not have any identifying properties, you should still use @identifiers with an empty array:\n\n```typespec\nmodel ResourceProperties {\n  @identifiers(#[])\n  array: ItemType[];\n}\n```\n\nThis will resolve the missing-x-ms-identifiers error without triggering the no-openapi error, and will ensure your spec is compliant with Azure guidelines. Do NOT suppress these errors unless you have explicit approval from the ARM review team, as suppressing them is only a last resort for legacy scenarios.\n\nSummary: Replace all usages of @OpenAPI.extension(\"x-ms-identifiers\", ...) with @identifiers(...) in your TypeSpec code. Do not suppress these errors unless absolutely necessary.",

            "answer": "You should NOT manually edit the autogenerated hardware.json file to work around TypeSpec or linter errors. Instead, you must address these issues at the TypeSpec source level and via configuration, following Azure TypeSpec best practices.\n1.ProvisioningState Must Be ReadOnly: The LintDiff check for `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` is triggered because the validation expects the type schema referenced by `provisioningState` to be `readOnly`, not just the property instance. The recommended (and officially supported) solution is to update your `tspconfig.yaml` to set:\n```\noptions:\n\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\":\nuse-read-only-status-schema: true\n```\nThis ensures all `ProvisioningState` schemas are emitted as `readOnly`, resolving the LintDiff error at the TypeSpec emission layer and removing the need to edit the generated Swagger.\n2.Missing Examples for Subscription-level APIs: The OpenAPI validation (ModelValidation) requires an example for each operation, including subscription-level (preview) APIs. If auto-generation tools like OAV are not generating examples for these, you must:\nManually add a valid example JSON file in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder of your TypeSpec project, ensuring the `operationId` matches your operation.\nThere is currently NO supported way to suppress example requirements in TypeSpec or Swagger for missing examples. Suppression can sometimes be done via labels (like `Approved-ModelValidation`) to unblock a PR, but the recommended approach is to provide at least one example per operation.\nGeneral Best Practices:\nDo NOT edit the emitted Swagger (`hardware.json`). Always make changes at the TypeSpec or configuration level.\nIf you encounter TypeSpec validation failures, refer to the TypeSpec source, emitter options, or required supporting files (such as examples or suppressions.yaml for certain rule types). For LintDiff, suppressions must be done in `readme.md` or `suppressions.yaml` (for TypeSpecRequirement errors only, not LintDiff or example requirements).\nSummary:\nSet `use-read-only-status-schema: true` in `tspconfig.yaml` to resolve the `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` error.\nAdd missing example files for all operations, including subscription-level ones, as there is no suppression for missing examples.\nNever edit the generated OpenAPI files to workaround linter errors.\nLet me know if you need guidance on creating an example file or configuring the emitter options.",

            "answer": "You should not manually edit the autogenerated OpenAPI (hardware.json) to work around linter or validation errors. All changes to the OpenAPI must originate from the TypeSpec source files to ensure consistency and compliance with Azure API guidelines. \n\nFor the `provisioningState` readOnly issue: The LintDiff check expects the `provisioningState` property to be marked as readOnly in the OpenAPI. However, due to legacy validation logic, it sometimes expects the entire type schema to be readOnly, not just the property. The correct way to resolve this in TypeSpec is to configure the TypeSpec emitter to always output `provisioningState` as readOnly. You can do this by adding the following to your `tspconfig.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nemit:\n  - \"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\"\noptions:\n  \"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\":\n    use-read-only-status-schema: true\n```\n\nIf you use the ARM scaffolding template, this option is enabled by default. This will ensure the generated OpenAPI marks `provisioningState` as readOnly and resolves the LintDiff violation without manual edits.\n\nFor missing examples on subscription-level preview APIs: Examples must be provided for every operation, including subscription-level APIs. The recommended workflow is:\n1. Design your API in TypeSpec.\n2. Generate OpenAPI via `tsp compile`.\n3. Use the `oav` tool to auto-generate example files for each operation (including subscription-level APIs). If `oav` does not generate examples for certain operations, you must manually create example JSON files in the appropriate `examples/<api-version>/` folder and ensure each example includes a unique `title` and the correct `operationId` matching the operation in TypeSpec/OpenAPI.\n\nDo not suppress TypeSpec validation errors unless you have a valid reason approved by ARM reviewers (such as a false positive or a rule that does not apply to your service). Suppression for time constraints or technical debt is not allowed. If you believe a validation error is a false positive, document it and request suppression via `suppressions.yaml` with a clear reason, but this is rarely approved for TypeSpec Validation failures.\n\nIn summary:\n- Do not manually edit OpenAPI files; fix issues in TypeSpec and emitter config.\n- Use `use-read-only-status-schema: true` for provisioningState.\n- Generate or manually add examples for all operations, including subscription-level APIs, in the examples folder.\n- Only request suppression for TypeSpec validation if you have a valid, approved reason.\n\nIf you continue to see validation failures after following these steps, ensure your local environment is up to date (`git pull`, `npm ci`) and recompile your TypeSpec files. If the issue persists, reach out to the TypeSpec Discussion Teams channel for further assistance.",

Currently there is one failure related to hardware.json (autogenerated OpenAPI file) having been modified. But the changes to hardware.json are to prevent other linter errors. The change to add readOnly to provisioningState was needed, as without it the Swagger LintDiff check failed asking to make it readOnly, and these changes were suggested by the representative in the ARM Office hours to work around the error. The other change in hardware.json is to add example for Preview API, which is subscription level API. the example markup was not getting auto-generated in the swagger json, so it needed to be added manually to prevent another swagger check of missing example from failing. Need some guidance to work around these errors.\\\\nFor these specific errors, not sure if there is a way to mark example files for subscription level API or suppress errors for these APIs, and also, any way to mark provisioningState readOnly in tsp file (note, the instance was already marked as readOnly, but the error is around marking the type as readOnly.\\\\nThanks!\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"You should not manually edit the autogenerated OpenAPI (hardware.json) to work around linter or validation errors. All changes to the OpenAPI must originate from the TypeSpec source files to ensure consistency and compliance with Azure API guidelines. \\\\n\\\\nFor the `provisioningState` readOnly issue: The LintDiff check expects the `provisioningState` property to be marked as readOnly in the OpenAPI. However, due to legacy validation logic, it sometimes expects the entire type schema to be readOnly, not just the property. The correct way to resolve this in TypeSpec is to configure the TypeSpec emitter to always output `provisioningState` as readOnly. You can do this by adding the following to your `tspconfig.yaml`:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nemit:\\\\n  - \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\"\\\\noptions:\\\\n  \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\":\\\\n    use-read-only-status-schema: true\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you use the ARM scaffolding template, this option is enabled by default. This will ensure the generated OpenAPI marks `provisioningState` as readOnly and resolves the LintDiff violation without manual edits.\\\\n\\\\nFor missing examples on subscription-level preview APIs: Examples must be provided for every operation, including subscription-level APIs. The recommended workflow is:\\\\n1. Design your API in TypeSpec.\\\\n2. Generate OpenAPI via `tsp compile`.\\\\n3. Use the `oav` tool to auto-generate example files for each operation (including subscription-level APIs). If `oav` does not generate examples for certain operations, you must manually create example JSON files in the appropriate `examples/<api-version>/` folder and ensure each example includes a unique `title` and the correct `operationId` matching the operation in TypeSpec/OpenAPI.\\\\n\\\\nDo not suppress TypeSpec validation errors unless you have a valid reason approved by ARM reviewers (such as a false positive or a rule that does not apply to your service). Suppression for time constraints or technical debt is not allowed. If you believe a validation error is a false positive, document it and request suppression via `suppressions.yaml` with a clear reason, but this is rarely approved for TypeSpec Validation failures.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary:\\\\n- Do not manually edit OpenAPI files; fix issues in TypeSpec and emitter config.\\\\n- Use `use-read-only-status-schema: true` for provisioningState.\\\\n- Generate or manually add examples for all operations, including subscription-level APIs, in the examples folder.\\\\n- Only request suppression for TypeSpec validation if you have a valid, approved reason.\\\\n\\\\nIf you continue to see validation failures after following these steps, ensure your local environment is up to date (`git pull`, `npm ci`) and recompile your TypeSpec files. If the issue persists, reach out to the TypeSpec Discussion Teams channel for further assistance.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You should NOT manually edit the autogenerated hardware.json file to work around TypeSpec or linter errors. Instead, you must address these issues at the TypeSpec source level and via configuration, following Azure TypeSpec best practices.\\\\n1.ProvisioningState Must Be ReadOnly: The LintDiff check for `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` is triggered because the validation expects the type schema referenced by `provisioningState` to be `readOnly`, not just the property instance.

            "answer": "You should not suppress this LintDiff validation error. The error `RequiredPropertiesMissingInResourceModel` indicates that your `SharingDetail` model is being interpreted as a resource model, but it does not contain the required ARM resource properties: `name`, `id`, and `type` (all marked as readOnly). According to Azure API and TypeSpec guidelines, all resource models must include these properties to be compliant.\nSuppressing this error is not the correct approach\u2014instead, you must fix your TypeSpec definition. Ensure that resource models either extend the appropriate common-types resource base model (such as `Resource`, `ProxyResource`, or `ExtensionResource`) or, if `SharingDetail` is not a resource, ensure it is not referenced in a way that causes it to be treated as one.\nFor suppressing LintDiff errors in general, you can add scoped suppressions in your `readme.md` following the guidance here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff#adding-scoped-suppressions. However, for this particular error, you are expected to fix your TypeSpec spec to meet the ARM requirements\u2014not suppress it.\nTo resolve this:\nIf `SharingDetail` is a resource, extend from the correct base model and add `id`, `name`, `type` (all readOnly).\nIf it is not a resource, check where it is referenced in your operations or model hierarchy to ensure it is not being treated as a resource by the code generator.",

            "answer": "Yes, it is possible to suppress the Swagger LintDiff validation error 'RequiredPropertiesMissingInResourceModel' for your 'SharingDetail' model, but it must be done in the readme.md file of your specification, not in the TypeSpec source itself. LintDiff suppressions are scoped to the OpenAPI/Swagger output and are applied via directives in readme.md. You cannot suppress LintDiff errors directly in TypeSpec files or via suppressions.yaml.\n\nTo suppress this error, follow the guidance in the Azure REST API Specs Wiki:\n\n1. Identify the exact path in the generated Swagger/OpenAPI where the error occurs (as shown in your error message).\n2. In your readme.md, add a suppression directive under the `directive` section, targeting the specific path and error code. For example:\n\n```yaml\ndirective:\n  - where:\n      - $.definitions.SharingDetail\n    suppress:\n      - RequiredPropertiesMissingInResourceModel\n```\n\nMake sure the path matches the element referenced in the error message. For more details and examples, see the official suppression documentation linked below.\n\nNote: While suppression is possible, it is generally recommended to fix the underlying model to comply with ARM guidelines (i.e., include 'name', 'id', and 'type' as readonly properties for resource models). Suppression should only be used when you have a valid justification and after consulting with your ARM reviewer.",

Identify the exact path in the generated Swagger/OpenAPI where the error occurs (as shown in your error message).\\\\n2. In your readme.md, add a suppression directive under the `directive` section, targeting the specific path and error code.

If any operation or model is referenced by a public operation, it will still be emitted as public in the SDK.\\\\n\\\\nIn practice, for Python SDK generation, marking all operations under the interface as internal and applying `@access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\")` to the interface should work, but only if the interface and its operations are not referenced by any public API surface. If you find that the interface still appears in the public client, it is likely because of such references or because the Python emitter does not fully honor the internal access setting for interfaces.\\\\n\\\\nThere is currently no supported way in TypeSpec to generate an interface for internal use only in Python SDK if it is referenced by public operations or models. The `@removed` decorator will remove the interface from all SDKs, which is not what you want. Also, Python SDK does not support removing exported classes using patch customization.\\\\n\\\\n**Recommended approach:**\\\\n- Ensure that the interface and its operations are not referenced by any public operation or model.\\\\n- Apply `@access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\")` to the interface and all its operations.\\\\n- If the interface is still emitted publicly, this is a limitation of the current TypeSpec tooling for Python, and there is no workaround that targets only Python.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to remove the interface only for Python, but keep it for other SDKs, this is not currently supported. You may need to revisit your API design to avoid exposing the interface publicly, or accept that it will be present in the Python SDK until the tooling supports more granular suppression.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"We do not support hiding an entire operation group directly.

            "answer": "No, TypeSpec does not support conditional imports based on API versions in main.tsp or anywhere else. All imports in TypeSpec are static and apply to the entire compilation unit, regardless of version. The correct way to exclude a resource type or model from a specific API version is to use the @removed decorator from the @typespec/versioning library on the types, models, or operations you want to remove for that version. For example:\n\n```typespec\nmodel MyResource {\n  // ... properties ...\n  @removed(Versions.v2024_12_01)\n  propertyToRemove: string;\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the resource or property is excluded from the generated OpenAPI spec for the specified version and all subsequent versions. If you are in preview, Azure policy is to only have a single active preview version, so you may also simply delete the resource type file if it is no longer needed. But for versioned retention, always use @removed and @added decorators to control visibility per version.\n\nConditional imports are not supported, and you should not attempt to work around this by manipulating imports. Use versioning decorators for all version-specific changes.",

These updates should be propagated to all versions, making your specs more accurate and helpful for all consumers. \n\nYou should NOT change the output path in tspconfig.yaml to exclude older versions just to avoid validation failures. This would break the reproducibility and versioning guarantees of TypeSpec and Azure API specs. Instead, update the descriptions in all relevant TypeSpec files so that the generated specs for all versions reflect the improved documentation. \n\nIf your CI or validation flags documentation-only changes as breaking, these should be easily approved, as they do not affect the wire shape or SDK generation.

            "answer": "To update the maximum value of `validityPeriodInDays` from 30 to 90 for only the new API version (`2025-11-01-preview`) in your TypeSpec definition, you must use TypeSpec's versioning patterns for breaking model changes. However, TypeSpec currently does not support versioning decorators on decorator arguments (like changing the `@maxValue` parameter per version). Directly updating the decorator value would affect all versions.\nThe correct Azure-compliant pattern is:\nCreate a new property (with a different internal name) for the updated constraint.\nUse `@removed` and `@renamedFrom` on the old property, and `@added` on the new property, both on the same model. This allows you to apply different constraints in different API versions without affecting other versions or causing duplicate operation errors.\nIf the operation signature/model type is changed for only the new version, use the add/remove/rename pattern and use `@sharedRoute` on both versions of the operation (see linked examples). This avoids the duplicate operation error and ensures correct OpenAPI emission for each version.\nExample:\n```\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\n// Old property: max 30 days, removed in new version\n@maxValue(30)\n@removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview, \"validityPeriodInDays\")\nvalidityPeriodInDaysV1: int32;\n// New property: max 90 days, only in new version\n@added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n@maxValue(90)\nvalidityPeriodInDays: int32;\n}\n```\nIn your operation/interface, you may need to do the same if the operation signature changes. If you want to have different models for different versions but keep the same route, use the `@sharedRoute` decorator and the `@renamedFrom` pattern for the operation as well (see the \"Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\" example in the docs).\nThis pattern will:\nPrevent duplicate operation errors (since each operation/model is only present in one version)\nEmit the correct schema per version\nNot require changing the operation name at the API surface (the renaming is internal)\nSummary:\nUse the add/remove/rename pattern for versioned property changes that affect validation/constraints.\nUse `@sharedRoute` and `@renamedFrom` for operations if the operation signature changes with the model.\nDo NOT update decorator arguments directly for just one version\u2014they affect all versions.",

This typically happens when versioning is not applied correctly to the operations or models, causing both to be present in the same emitted OpenAPI spec.\n\nTo resolve this, you should use TypeSpec's versioning decorators (`@added`, `@removed`, and `@renamedFrom`) to ensure that each operation and model is only present in the intended API version. Specifically:\n\n1. **Use `@added` and `@removed` on operations:**\n   - For the older version (`2025-08-01-preview`), annotate the operation with `@removed(Versions.v2)` (assuming `v2` is your new version).\n   - For the new version (`2025-11-01-preview`), annotate the operation with `@added(Versions.v2)`.\n   - If you need to rename the operation, use `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \"getV1\")`.\n   - Use `@sharedRoute` if both operations share the same route.\n\n2. **Version your models and properties:**\n   - For the property `validityPeriodInDays`, use `@added` or `@removed` to control its presence or constraints per version.\n   - If the model itself changes, use `@renamedFrom` or versioned model definitions.\n\n**Example:**\n```typespec\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Policies {\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \"getV1\")\n  @sharedRoute\n  getV1 is ArmResourceRead<LeafCertificateConfigurationV1>;\n\n  @added(Versions.v2)\n  @sharedRoute\n  get is ArmResourceRead<LeafCertificateConfigurationV2>;\n}\n\nmodel LeafCertificateConfigurationV1 {\n  validityPeriodInDays: int32 @maxValue(30);\n}\n\n@added(Versions.v2)\nmodel LeafCertificateConfigurationV2 {\n  validityPeriodInDays: int32 @maxValue(90);\n}\n```\nThis ensures that only one operation is present per API version, avoiding duplicate routes in the emitted OpenAPI spec.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Do not have two operations with the same route and method in the same API version.\n- Use versioning decorators to control which operations and models are present in each version.\n- If the operation signature changes, use `@sharedRoute` and versioned operation names.\n\nIf you follow this pattern, Swagger generation should succeed without duplicate operation errors.",

The Response suggests using separate models for each version and versioning decorators on operations and models, but does not mention the limitation of decorator arguments or the recommended property-level add/remove/rename pattern.  \\n3. The Response provides an example with two models (`LeafCertificateConfigurationV1` and `LeafCertificateConfigurationV2`), each with different `@maxValue`, which is not the recommended pattern in the Ground Truth.  \\n4. The Response does mention using `@sharedRoute`, `@added`, `@removed`, and `@renamedFrom` for operations, which aligns with part of the Ground Truth, but misses the key point about property-level versioning and the decorator argument limitation.  \\n5. The Response does not warn against directly updating decorator arguments for just one version, which is a critical point in the Ground Truth.  \\n6.

            "answer": "You cannot directly version a decorator such as @pattern in TypeSpec; decorators themselves are not versioned. This means that if you update a pattern in your TypeSpec model, it will apply to all API versions emitted by TypeSpec, not just a new version. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid hidden inconsistencies between the declared API surface and the actual backend behavior.\nIf you need different validation patterns (such as a new regex for a resource name) for a specific API version and newer, you have two supported options in TypeSpec:\nIf the new pattern applies to all versions: Update the @pattern decorator in the model directly. This is the common and recommended path if your backend enforces the new pattern for all versions.\nIf the pattern truly differs by API version (rare, and usually discouraged): You must explicitly version the type. For example, you can introduce a new scalar type or model for the new version, and use the @typeChangedFrom or @renamedFrom decorators to describe the transition between versions. This approach requires you to manage versioning logic in TypeSpec, not in the generated OpenAPI/JSON files. You should not edit the generated files by hand, and manual changes to JSON files are not supported.\nHere's a sketch of the pattern versioning approach:\n```\n/** Legacy pattern type for old API versions */\n@pattern(\"^[a-z0-9]{3,18}$\")\nscalar ResourceNameLegacy extends string;\nmodel MyResource {\n@key(\"resourceName\")\n@typeChangedFrom(Versions.v2, ResourceNameLegacy)\n@pattern(\"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$\")\nname: string;\n}\n```\nIn this example, TypeSpec will emit the old pattern for older API versions and the new pattern for v2 and above, but you must structure your code accordingly. Note that this approach can lead to more complicated TypeSpec code and is only justified if your backend actually enforces different rules per API version.\nSummary: Do not manually edit JSON files generated by TypeSpec. Use versioning decorators and, if necessary, versioned types to achieve per-version differences. But for most cases, apply the new pattern universally if the service behavior matches. This approach keeps your TypeSpec code clear and maintainable.",

Decorators like @pattern are not versioned\u2014if you add a pattern to the ResourceNameParameter, it will apply to all API versions, and this is considered a breaking change for older versions if the pattern is more restrictive than before.\n\nThe recommended approach is:\n- If your service enforces the same validation for resource names across all API versions, update the pattern restriction for all versions. This ensures the spec accurately reflects service behavior and avoids inconsistencies. This is not a breaking change if the service always enforced the pattern, even if it was missing from the spec.\n- If your service actually validates differently across versions (which is rare), you would need to create separate models for each version, but this leads to duplication and is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.\n\nYou should NOT manually edit the generated JSON from 'tsp compile' to add the pattern. All changes must be made in TypeSpec source files so that the spec remains the source of truth and is maintainable.\n\nIn summary: Unless your service truly validates names differently between versions, update the pattern for all versions in TypeSpec. If this is a bug fix (the pattern was always enforced but missing from the spec), apply it everywhere. If it is a new restriction, you must go through the breaking change review process.

The ground truth provides a code sketch for versioning patterns, which is not present in the response.\\n4. Both the response and ground truth emphasize not manually editing generated JSON files.\\n5. The response summarizes the recommended approach and breaking change review, which aligns with the ground truth.\\n6. The response misses some minor details, such as the explicit mention of versioning decorators and the code example, but covers most of the key points.\\n</S0>\\n<S1>The response contains most of the necessary and relevant information, but omits some minor details such as the explicit mention of versioning decorators and the illustrative code example.

            "answer": "You cannot directly version the LRO headers (such as ArmAsyncOperationHeader or ArmLroLocationHeader) or the Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia annotation with @added(version) in TypeSpec. Instead, the recommended approach is to version the operation itself. \n\nTo achieve this, you should:\n1. Use @sharedRoute on both the old and new operations so they share the same route.\n2. In the new API version, remove or rename the old operation (using @removed and @renamedFrom decorators) and introduce a new operation with the updated behavior (e.g., optional request body, LRO headers, and useFinalStateVia annotation).\n3. For the new operation, set OptionalRequestBody = true and specify the desired LRO headers (e.g., ArmAsyncOperationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet> or ArmLroLocationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet>) as template parameters.\n\nThis pattern ensures that the new LRO behavior and headers are only present in the new API version, while the old version remains unchanged and backward compatible. You cannot version the headers or annotations themselves, but you can version the operation and its parameters/templates.\n\nExample:\n```typespec\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface RuleSets {\n  // Old operation (removed in new version)\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`, \"createOrUpdate\")\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`)\n  @sharedRoute\n  createOrUpdateOld is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<RuleSet>;\n\n  // New operation (added in new version)\n  @sharedRoute\n  createOrUpdate is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync<\n    RuleSet,\n    OptionalRequestBody = true,\n    LroHeaders = ArmAsyncOperationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet> & ArmLroLocationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet>\n  >;\n}\n```\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure API guidelines and TypeSpec best practices for versioning.",

Instead, the recommended approach is to version the operation itself. \\\\n\\\\nTo achieve this, you should:\\\\n1. Use @sharedRoute on both the old and new operations so they share the same route.\\\\n2. In the new API version, remove or rename the old operation (using @removed and @renamedFrom decorators) and introduce a new operation with the updated behavior (e.g., optional request body, LRO headers, and useFinalStateVia annotation).\\\\n3. For the new operation, set OptionalRequestBody = true and specify the desired LRO headers (e.g., ArmAsyncOperationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet> or ArmLroLocationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet>) as template parameters.\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern ensures that the new LRO behavior and headers are only present in the new API version, while the old version remains unchanged and backward compatible. You cannot version the headers or annotations themselves, but you can version the operation and its parameters/templates.\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface RuleSets {\\\\n  // Old operation (removed in new version)\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`, \\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\")\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`)\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\n  createOrUpdateOld is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<RuleSet>;\\\\n\\\\n  // New operation (added in new version)\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\n  createOrUpdate is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync<\\\\n    RuleSet,\\\\n    OptionalRequestBody = true,\\\\n    LroHeaders = ArmAsyncOperationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet> & ArmLroLocationHeader<FinalResult = RuleSet>\\\\n  >;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure API guidelines and TypeSpec best practices for versioning.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"here's a [playground](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground/?options=%7B%22linterRuleSet%22%3A%7B%22extends%22%3A%5B%22%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-azure-rulesets%2Fresource-manager%22%5D%7D%7D&c=aW1wb3J0ICJAdHlwZXNwZWMvaHR0cCI7CtIZcmVzdNUZdmVyc2lvbmluZ8wfYXp1cmUtdG9vbHMvyCstxhVjb3Jl3yvIK3Jlc291cmNlLW1hbmFnZXIiOwoKdXNpbmcgSHR0cDvHDFJlc3TIDFbpAI7IEkHESi5Db3JlzhJSx1xNxls7CgovKiogQ29udG9zb8RUxR4gUHJvdmlkZXIg5gCDbWVudCBBUEkuICovCkBhcm3IIE5hbWVzcGFjZQpAc2VydmljZSgjeyB0aXRsZTogIsdXyC1IdWJDbGllbnQiIH0pCkDnAUNlZCjnAL9zKQpuyFAgTWljcm9zb2Z0LtJG7wC2QVBJIMdNc%2BQAoWVudW3oARNzIHsKICDELjIwMjUtMTAtMDEtcHJldmlld8g1xDQgIOQA10NvbW1vblTkAY%2FHQCj1ATcuyykuyGoudjUpCiAgYNJpYCwK8ACFN%2F8Ahf8Ahf8AhesAhclpYCwKfeYBOEHoATrrAVMg6AJ15ACIbW9kZWwgRW1wbG95ZWUgaXMgVHJhY2tlZOgAgjzIHFByb3BlcnRpZXM%2B5QFpLi7pAKbkAhtQYXJhbWV0ZXLJMT476ACGyV9wyUTSfMpg6QHIQWdlIG9mIGXIP%2BUBOGFnZT86IGludDMyO%2BgBbENpdHnSKmNpdHk%2FOiBzdHLlAy7HLFByb2ZpbNNZQGVuY29kZSgiYmFzZTY0dXJsIuQBYHDGMD86IGJ5dGVzyUhUaGUgc3RhdHVzxEt0aGUgbGFzdCDkAMVhdGlvbuUDQSAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAeBhZMddxCDlA9BTdGF0xGflAavMFOkBSMRzzDLlAIDlAMph6QHVxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQCctFU5QFk5gEa6QKyxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QTq6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBULHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QP96QN3bW926gHK6QN5TW92ZVLHFegDcsRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA1DLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBIvmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AZhT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYHIy7LKXt9CuUG%2F8gjyhvLWegAzeYEs2dldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFEOQEEHJl5Ab6ZEZyb23pBw4u9QXFICLmAqlPcuUC1WXlBI9AcmXkAPzqB0rVPMUqc2hhcmVkUm91dGXkBQ7NTE9sZO8ArEPHIFJlcGxhY2VBc3luY%2BwAvN9RxU71AVVMZWdhY3ku1WAKICAg6QFGLMUOT3DkAWZhbOcCm0JvZHkgPSB0cnXEdOUAiOUD%2FMZxcm1DdXN0b21QYXRjaFPXUvYAl0ZvdW7kBCvkAUPIHOYAy03kAonGSdBLyhDqBq%2FFGT7oAJ3mA5%2FvAVzlA5xlV2l0aG91dE9r8wFcbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3Jp5QE%2BxzvGM8wZzDnoB2Ugc2FtcGzrBGthY8VEdGhhdOYDaOkHKHRvIGRpZmZl5ACE7wPrxSnuALJBxUjlAZbIdyzsBHbIDeYD7fMAkkhFQUTqB1HEfmNoZWNr6gCqZXhpc3RlbuYIyyDGHkXJFO8C4M0d7gim&e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest&vs=%7B%7D) showing how you would version a required to optional request body for a templated async put operation:\\\\n```\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\nget is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;\\\\n@renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`, \\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\")\\\\n@removed(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`)\\\\n@sharedRoute\\\\ncreateOrUpdateOld is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;\\\\n@sharedRoute\\\\ncreateOrUpdate is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nOptionalRequestBody = true\\\\n>;\\\\nupdate is ArmCustomPatchSync<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nAzure.ResourceManager.Foundations.ResourceUpdateModel<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nEmployeeProperties\\\\n>\\\\n>;\\\\ndelete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Employee>;\\\\nlistByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;\\\\nlistBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;\\\\n/** A sample resource action that move employee to different location */\\\\nmove is ArmResourceActionSync<Employee, MoveRequest, MoveResponse>;\\\\n/** A sample HEAD operation to check resource existence */\\\\ncheckExistence is ArmResourceCheckExistence<Employee>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nthe trick is to use @sharedRoute in the old and new operations and to rename and remove the old operation in the new version.\\\"}\"}]",

'age' appears in the second, stable version and all subsequent versions,  'profile' appears in the first (preview) version, is removed in the stable version, and then added back again in the subsequent preview version.\nNotably, this practice of adding a property at each preview version and removing it at each stable is easy to get wrong.\nthe official Azure policy is to have only one active preview, as much as that is possible with api retention requirements.  So that, when you introduce a new preview version, the older preview is removed, ideally, this means that, especially when you just had a stable release, you remove support for the previous preview when (or soon after) you add the new preview version.\nYou can see more details about versioning in typespec here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/versioning/)",

            "answer": "Yes, in TypeSpec you can manage properties so that they only appear in preview versions and are omitted from stable releases, but there are important nuances and best practices to follow according to Azure guidelines and TypeSpec versioning semantics.\n\n1. **Preview and Stable Version Management**:\n   - You can have multiple API versions in your enum, and you can mark preview versions with `@previewVersion`.\n   - The official Azure policy is to have only one active preview version at a time. When you introduce a new preview version, you should retire the previous preview version (after a retention period if needed). This means that, ideally, only the latest preview and the latest stable versions are active and supported.\n\n2. **Property Versioning**:\n   - To have a property (e.g., `faultSimulation`) appear only in preview versions and not in stable, you use the `@added` and `@removed` decorators:\n     - `@added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)` will make the property appear in that preview and all subsequent versions unless removed.\n     - To omit it from a stable version, use `@removed(Versions.v2025_01_01)` (assuming that's your stable version), and then you can re-add it in a subsequent preview with `@added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)`.\n   - This pattern ensures the property is present in the preview, omitted from stable, and then present again in the next preview.\n\n3. **Why Generation Removes from Previous Previews**:\n   - When you mark a property with `@added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)`, it will only appear in that version and subsequent ones. If you want it to appear in multiple preview versions, you need to use `@added` for each preview version or manage the decorators so that it is present in the desired versions.\n   - However, the recommended approach is to retire older preview versions when a new preview is introduced, so only the latest preview and stable are supported. This aligns with Azure guidelines and avoids confusion or breaking changes.\n\n4. **Example TypeSpec Pattern**:\n```typespec\nenum Versions {\n  v2024_11_01_preview,\n  v2025_01_01, // stable\n  @previewVersion\n  v2025_07_01_preview\n}\n\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\n  // Property present in first preview\n  @added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_01_01)\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\n\n  // Property re-added in new preview\n  @added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\n}\n```\n\n5. **Best Practice**:\n   - When moving features from preview to stable, update decorators so that only stable features are present in the stable version. Preview-only features should be removed from stable and re-added in the next preview if needed.\n   - Avoid having multiple active preview versions; retire older previews as soon as possible.\n\n**Summary:**\nYou can control property presence across preview and stable versions using `@added` and `@removed` decorators. Only the latest preview and stable versions should be active, and properties should be versioned accordingly. If you see generation removing a property from previous previews, it's because only the latest preview is considered active, and the property is only present in the version you marked with `@added`. This is by design and aligns with Azure API guidelines.",

We have some properties that we don't want to include in a stable release just yet, but don't want that to hold us from releasing the other properties in a stable release.\\\\nCan we have multiple versions marked with @previewVersion? How do we handle a property that is in multiple preview versions, but we want to keep out of stable versions?\\\\nFor a practical example, we have the faultSimulation apis in our spec in 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview. If I mark 2025-07-01-preview with @previewVersion and faultSimulation with @added(versions.v2025_07_01_preview), the generation removes it from the previous preview specs.\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"Yes, in TypeSpec you can manage properties so that they only appear in preview versions and are omitted from stable releases, but there are important nuances and best practices to follow according to Azure guidelines and TypeSpec versioning semantics.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Preview and Stable Version Management**:\\\\n   - You can have multiple API versions in your enum, and you can mark preview versions with `@previewVersion`.\\\\n   - The official Azure policy is to have only one active preview version at a time. When you introduce a new preview version, you should retire the previous preview version (after a retention period if needed). This means that, ideally, only the latest preview and the latest stable versions are active and supported.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Property Versioning**:\\\\n   - To have a property (e.g., `faultSimulation`) appear only in preview versions and not in stable, you use the `@added` and `@removed` decorators:\\\\n     - `@added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)` will make the property appear in that preview and all subsequent versions unless removed.\\\\n     - To omit it from a stable version, use `@removed(Versions.v2025_01_01)` (assuming that's your stable version), and then you can re-add it in a subsequent preview with `@added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)`.\\\\n   - This pattern ensures the property is present in the preview, omitted from stable, and then present again in the next preview.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Why Generation Removes from Previous Previews**:\\\\n   - When you mark a property with `@added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)`, it will only appear in that version and subsequent ones. If you want it to appear in multiple preview versions, you need to use `@added` for each preview version or manage the decorators so that it is present in the desired versions.\\\\n   - However, the recommended approach is to retire older preview versions when a new preview is introduced, so only the latest preview and stable are supported. This aligns with Azure guidelines and avoids confusion or breaking changes.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Example TypeSpec Pattern**:\\\\n```typespec\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\n  v2024_11_01_preview,\\\\n  v2025_01_01, // stable\\\\n  @previewVersion\\\\n  v2025_07_01_preview\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\\\\n  // Property present in first preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_01_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property re-added in new preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n5. **Best Practice**:\\\\n   - When moving features from preview to stable, update decorators so that only stable features are present in the stable version. Preview-only features should be removed from stable and re-added in the next preview if needed.\\\\n   - Avoid having multiple active preview versions; retire older previews as soon as possible.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\nYou can control property presence across preview and stable versions using `@added` and `@removed` decorators. Only the latest preview and stable versions should be active, and properties should be versioned accordingly. If you see generation removing a property from previous previews, it's because only the latest preview is considered active, and the property is only present in the version you marked with `@added`. This is by design and aligns with Azure API guidelines.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"TypeSpec versioning works in the following way:\\\\nAll types in the spec are automatically part of the initial api-version\\\\nWhen a new api-version is introduced,  any new types `use@added(VERSION)` decorators to indicate they were added in that version, they are impliciutly included in every subsequent version\\\\nWhen a type does not appear in one version, then you use `@removed(VERSION)` to remove the type at that version, by default, it will not appear any subsequent versions.

It can be added back using `@added` [Here is a playground](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground/?options=%7B%22linterRuleSet%22%3A%7B%22extends%22%3A%5B%22%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-azure-rulesets%2Fresource-manager%22%5D%7D%7D&c=aW1wb3J0ICJAdHlwZXNwZWMvaHR0cCI7CtIZcmVzdNUZdmVyc2lvbmluZ8wfYXp1cmUtdG9vbHMvyCstxhVjb3Jl3yvIK3Jlc291cmNlLW1hbmFnZXIiOwoKdXNpbmcgSHR0cDvHDFJlc3TIDFbpAI7IEkHESi5Db3JlzhJSx1xNxls7CgovKiogQ29udG9zb8RUxR4gUHJvdmlkZXIg5gCDbWVudCBBUEkuICovCkBhcm3IIE5hbWVzcGFjZQpAc2VydmljZSgjeyB0aXRsZTogIsdXyC1IdWJDbGllbnQiIH0pCkDnAUNlZCjnAL9zKQpuyFAgTWljcm9zb2Z0LtJG7wC2QVBJIMdNc%2BQAoWVudW3oARNzIHsKICDELjIwMjEtMTAtMDEtcHJldmlld8g1xDQgIEB1c2VEZXBlbmRlbmN5KPUBLy7IVi52MV8wX1DGSF8xKcRAYXJtQ29tbW9uVOQBz8cq10jLKctUNcRIYPIAqWAsCuoAxTTGHP8Avf8Avf8Avf8Avf4AvecAoe0AtTUtMDf%2FAXr%2FAL3%2FAL3%2FAL3%2FAL3qAL3vAKlgLAp95gJtQegCb%2BsCiCDoA6rkAMhtb2RlbCBFbXBsb3llZSBpcyBUcmFja2Vk6ACCPMgcUHJvcGVydGllcz7lAp4uLukApuQDUFBhcmFtZXRlcskxPjvoAIbJX3DJRNJ8ymDpAv1BZ2Ugb2YgZcg%2F5gF4YWRk6wN%2BLuwBveQBEGFnZT86IGludDMyO%2BgBzENpdHnSSmNpdHk%2FOiBzdHLlBIPHLFByb2ZpbNR5cmVtb3bce%2FQAm%2FABm8UoZW5jb2RlKCJiYXNlNjR1cmwixBdwxno%2FOiBieXRlc%2BkAklRoZSBzdGF0dXPkAJV0aGUgbGFzdCDkAS9hdGlvbuUE4CAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAkphZMddxCDlBW9TdGF0xGflAhXMFOkBssRzzDLlAIDlARRh6QI%2FxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQDHNFU5QHO5gFk6QNcxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QaJ6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBuHHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QRn6QPh5AMh6QHK6QPjTW92ZVLHFegD3MRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA5rLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBPXmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AgAT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYIwi7LKXt9CuUInsgjyhvLWegAzeYFHWdldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFeiDnAntPcuUCp%2BUB1ssvQ8cdUmVwbGFjZUFzeW5jzj%2FlAvfIN0N1c3RvbVBhdGNoU8QqCiAgIOkAkyzFDvYA50ZvdW7kAybkBQ7IHOYAkU3kAYTGSdBLyhDqBhTFGT4KICDlAJ3mAprvANTlApdlV2l0aG91dE9r8wDUbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3JpcOUCecY7xjPMGcw56AbKIHNhbXBs6wNmYWPFRHRoYXTmAmPpBm10byBkaWZmZeQAhO8C5sUp7gCyQcVI5QGWyHcs7ANxyA3mAujzAJJIRUFE6gZMxH5jaGVja%2BoAqmV4aXN0ZW7mCDAgxh5FyRTvAljNHe4ICw%3D%3D&e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest&vs=%7B%7D)\\\\n```\\\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\n/** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\\\n@useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\n`2021-10-01-preview`,\\\\n/** 2024-10-01 version */\\\\n@useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\n`2024-10-01`,\\\\n/** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\n@useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\n`2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\n}\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource<EmployeeProperties> {\\\\n...ResourceNameParameter<Employee>;\\\\n}\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\n/** Age of employee */\\\\n@added(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\nage?: int32;\\\\n/** City of employee */\\\\ncity?: string;\\\\n/** Profile of employee */\\\\n@removed(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\n@added(Versions.`2025-07-01-preview`)\\\\n@encode(\\\\\\\"base64url\\\\\\\")\\\\nprofile?: bytes;\\\\n/** The status of the last operation. */\\\\n@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\nprovisioningState?: ProvisioningState;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nshowing two propertties (EmployeeProperties.age and EmployeeProperties.profile) that use versioning.  'age' appears in the second, stable version and all subsequent versions,  'profile' appears in the first (preview) version, is removed in the stable version, and then added back again in the subsequent preview version.\\\\nNotably, this practice of adding a property at each preview version and removing it at each stable is easy to get wrong.\\\\nthe official Azure policy is to have only one active preview, as much as that is possible with api retention requirements.  So that, when you introduce a new preview version, the older preview is removed, ideally, this means that, especially when you just had a stable release, you remove support for the previous preview when (or soon after) you add the new preview version.\\\\nYou can see more details about versioning in typespec here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/versioning/)\\\"}\"}]",
