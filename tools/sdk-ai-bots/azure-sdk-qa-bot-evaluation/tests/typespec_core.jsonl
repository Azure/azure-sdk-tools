Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\n```\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: string;\n// ... other properties ...\n}\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: \"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\";\nrecoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\nAction Items:\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "Emitter usage", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/json-schema/reference/emitter"}, {"title": "Tutorial", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/guide"}, {"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "OpenAPI v3 emitter", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/openapi3/openapi"}, {"title": "Azure REST API Specification Directory Structure", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Specification-Folder-Structure-Guide"}, {"title": "TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy Decorators Mapping to Swagger Documentation", "link": ""}, {"title": "OpenAPI3 to TypeSpec", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/openapi3/cli"}, {"title": "Common Parameters", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/04-common-parameters"}, {"title": "equivalent PrxoyResource even without system data", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy V1.3.2", "link": ""}, {"title": "how do i use discriminated union", "link": ""}, {"title": "Built-in Decorators", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-decorators"}, {"title": "Built-in Data types", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-data-types"}, {"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "What is TypeSpec?", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec"}, {"title": "Multiple layers of inheritance for discriminative model", "link": ""}, {"title": "Changing Property to Optional with Default", "link": ""}, {"title": "Usages for Test for @clientLocation decorator - moving operations between clients", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/blob/main/packages/azure-http-specs/specs/azure/client-generator-core/client-location/move-to-new-sub-client/main.tsp"}, {"title": "TypeSpec PR Diff Validation Queries", "link": ""}, {"title": "Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR", "link": ""}, {"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "Generated Types", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types"}, {"title": "Discriminated Types", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/discriminated-types"}, {"title": "Extending 'Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.ProxyResource' that doesn't define a discriminator.", "link": ""}, {"title": "Is it possible to make a field to be optional only on new api version?", "link": ""}, {"title": "remove `TypeSpec.Http.OkResponse` from Swagger", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}], "expected_references": [{"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "Generated Types - Discriminator", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types"}, {"title": "Built-in Decorators: @discriminator", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-decorators"}]}
