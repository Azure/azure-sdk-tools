The Avocado check (MULTIPLE_API_VERSION) was recently made a blocking error to enforce this policy.\nTo temporarily suppress this failure and unblock your PR, you can add the Approved-Avocado label to your PR. However, this is only a one-time suppression and should be done if:\nThere is an ongoing discussion and plan to resolve the uniform versioning issue for Compute.\nYou or your team are aware that this is a temporary measure and are working towards compliance.\nImportant: Regular use of this suppression is discouraged. The long-term solution is to restructure your API versions so all components under Compute adopt a uniform versioning scheme, or split into independent services as outlined in the Uniform Versioning Violation Guide.\nIf you are not aware of any ongoing discussion or plan for resolution, you should reach out to azversioning@service.microsoft.com for guidance.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "Looking for someone to suppress CI failures https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36221 | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "Looking for someone to suppress CI failures https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36221 | answer", "link": ""}, {"title": "Code Generation - C#", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/code-generation-csharp"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/PR-Check-Modernization"}, {"title": "Code Generation - JavaScript", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/code-generation-javascript"}, {"title": "Considerations for Service Design", "link": "https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/ConsiderationsForServiceDesign.md"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec"}, {"title": "Example", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Deprecating-Preview-APIs"}, {"title": "Handling Errors | Introduction", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/03-handling-errors"}, {"title": "Running Locally", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff"}, {"title": "Remaining Work", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/ARM-Auto-SignOff"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-specs-pr"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Deprecating-Preview-APIs"}, {"title": "good", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "Directives | #suppress | Api", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/directives"}, {"title": "Emitter usage | Emitter options | `dev-options`", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/http-client-java/reference/emitter"}, {"title": "Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec | Conversion process | Conversion plan completion", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec-conversion"}, {"title": "Create a pull request with your Azure REST API spec update", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-specs-pr"}, {"title": "Azure Versioning Guidelines | History", "link": "https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/VersioningGuidelines.md"}, {"title": "Test PRs", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/ARM-Auto-SignOff"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/API-Spec-Review-FAQ"}, {"title": "Avocado error after @renamedFrom on custom action route | answer", "link": ""}, {"title": "Suppress validation failures on a PR | Suppression cases table", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "Azure REST API Specification Directory Structure | Contact Us", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Specification-Folder-Structure-Guide"}, {"title": "Uniform Versioning Violation Guide | CI Validation", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Uniform-Versioning-Violation-Guide"}, {"title": "Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR | question", "link": ""}, {"title": "Table of Contents | Overview", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/SDK-Breaking-Changes"}, {"title": "Suppress validation failures on a PR", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "bad | Troubleshooting AutoRest suppressions not working | When in doubt: search the repository for existing suppressions", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions"}, {"title": "Table of Contents | How to Suppress the SDK Breaking Changes | Next Steps", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/SDK-Breaking-Changes"}], "expected_references": [{"title": "Looking for someone to suppress CI failures https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36221 | question", "link": ""}]}
