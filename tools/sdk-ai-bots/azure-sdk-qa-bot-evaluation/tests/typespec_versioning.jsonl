Is there a way to do conditional imports based off of version in main?\nThank you in advance!", "ground_truth": "no, you have to mark the models/types and everything that you want to remove with the @removed decorator using the versioning library\nif you are in preview version I think also the policy is to only have a single preview version in the spec repo at the timme now so you could also just delete it", "expected_reference_urls": ["https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning"],"context": "", "response_length": 295}
{"testcase": "Description changes across versions?", "query": "title: Description changes across versions?\n\nquestion: Hi, as part of this PR: [Service Fabric Managed Clusters - API version 2025-03-01-preview · Azure/azure-rest-api-specs@599e269](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/actions/runs/14090043123/job/39464153437?pr=33332)\nMy team wanted to add more details to a model description. This change results in a change in all spec versions generated with Typespec, and causes the Typespec validation to fail if I don't include the changes to the older specs.\nI wanted to know what the best course of action was for passing this check. Since we don't expect updates to our older specs, is it ok to just change the output path in our tspconfig.yaml to only point at the current version of the output spec? Or is there a better way to handle this?", "ground_truth": "Honestly, the best thing is to update your docs and take the update in previous versions (which are likely now more accurately described as well). Documentation updates are not breaking changes, and, if changes are limited to documentation, this should be passed easily by the breaking change board.", "expected_reference_urls": [], "context": "", "response_length": 299}
