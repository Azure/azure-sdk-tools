{"rows": [{"inputs.query": "title: Fixing Invalid Type Specifications and SDK Regeneration in Released APIs\n\nquestion: Hi Azure SDK Onboarding,\nOur team found an invalid type specification in our previous 2 API releases (1 preview, 1 stable).  I've read through (lightly) the breaking change deep dive, which looks like I'll have to reach out to the review board to get their approval, however, I was wondering what is the recommended way to implement a fix for existing APIs, up to the point where it can be reviewed by ARM and Breaking changes board.\nNormally, I would create a branch, commit a base version for review, then create a release plan against the new branch (then add in changes, get ARM sign off, then request the sdk release).\nHow do I regenerate the SDKs once I have a fix in place for the previously released verisons?  Will they require manual updates (e.g. create a PR in each sdk repo with a fix)?\nAny guidance would be appreciated!", "inputs.ground_truth": "To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs and regenerate SDKs, you should follow these steps:\nFix the Spec and Follow Breaking Change Process: If your fix is a breaking change or a bug fix in an already released API version, you must submit a PR against the main branch of the public Azure REST API specs repository. If your PR is labeled with BreakingChangeReviewRequired or VersioningReviewRequired, you must get approval from the Breaking Change Review Board (see aka.ms/brch). For bug fixes, you may be able to apply the BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix label yourself, but the process should be strictly followed.\nARM Review: Once the breaking change review is resolved, request ARM review. Note: You cannot proceed to ARM review until the breaking change process is complete.\nSDK Generation and Release Plan:\nFor TypeSpec-based management plane SDKs (Java, JavaScript, Python, Go):\nUse the release planner to request SDK generation for the fixed API version. This will create a tracking issue in the Azure/sdk-release-request repo.\nThe Shanghai SDK team will generate the SDK and open a PR in the corresponding SDK repository. However, it is the service owner's responsibility to follow up, complete any customizations, and drive the PR through review and merge. You will be notified when the PR is created.\nAfter the SDK is generated, follow the release guidance to publish the package.\nFor .NET: Service owners must generate the SDK manually using the updated TypeSpec, then create and submit a PR to the azure-sdk-for-net repository.\nManual Follow-Up: While the initial SDK PRs for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go are created automatically after you request generation, you are still responsible for any manual updates, review, and merging of these PRs. For .NET, all steps are manual after generation.\nSummary:\nYou do not need to manually create PRs in each SDK repo for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go; the release planner and SDK generation pipelines will create draft PRs for you after you request generation.\nYou must still review, customize (if needed), and drive the SDK PRs to completion.\nFor .NET, the process is manual: you generate and submit the PR yourself.\nAlways ensure you have breaking change and ARM approvals before requesting SDK generation.\nFor more details, see the referenced documentation below.", "inputs.response": "To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs (both preview and stable), you should follow a structured process that ensures compliance with Azure SDK and ARM review requirements, as well as proper handling of breaking changes:\n\n1. **Create a Release Branch and Plan**: Start by creating a dedicated release branch for your fix in the Azure REST API specs repository. Then, create a release plan in the Release Planner tool to track the work and ensure all steps are documented.\n\n2. **Implement the Fix**: Update the type specification in your API spec (TypeSpec or OpenAPI) on the release branch. Make sure the changes are isolated to the affected versions (preview and stable) and do not introduce unrelated changes.\n\n3. **Breaking Change Review**: Since this is a breaking change to a previously released API, you must email the Breaking Change Board (azbreakchangereview@microsoft.com) for approval. The ARM review board will also need to review your changes if this is a management plane API. Ensure your PR includes clear documentation of the change and its impact.\n\n4. **ARM Review and Approval**: Submit a pull request with your changes against the release branch. The ARM review board will review the PR. Address any feedback and obtain required approvals.\n\n5. **SDK Regeneration and Updates**:\n   - Once the spec fix is merged, SDK generation pipelines will NOT automatically trigger for previously released versions. You will need to manually initiate SDK regeneration for each affected language and version.\n   - For each SDK repo (.NET, Java, Python, JS/TS, Go), create a manual PR that updates the SDK to reflect the fixed type specification. This involves regenerating the SDK from the updated spec and pushing the changes to a new branch in each SDK repo.\n   - Ensure you follow the standard SDK release process, including updating CHANGELOG.md, adding tests/samples as needed, and obtaining APIView approval for GA releases.\n\n6. **SDK Release**: After all manual PRs are reviewed and merged, run the release pipelines for each SDK to publish the updated packages. Make sure to approve only the relevant packages in the pipeline.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Breaking changes require explicit review and approval by ARM and the Breaking Change Board.\n- SDKs for previously released versions must be manually regenerated and updated via PRs in each SDK repo.\n- Use the Release Planner to track the process and ensure compliance with Azure SDK release guidelines.\n\nIf you need further help with the process or tooling, reach out via the provided Teams channels or email contacts.", "inputs.context": "[{\"document_source\":\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\",\"document_filename\":\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\",\"document_title\":\"bad\",\"document_link\":\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions\",\"content\":\"# bad\\n## Implementation details\\n# docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\n\\n# bad\\n\\n## Implementation details\\n\\nThe contents of this article is primarily derived from the following source code:\\r\\n- [`openapi-alps` repo] / `azure-rest-api-specs.yml` configs\\r\\n- [`openapi-alps` repo] / `requiredLabelRules.ts`\\r\\nAs such, if you find a discrepancy:\\r\\n1.

It handles both data-plane\\r\\n and management-plane OpenAPI specs. The produced TypeSpec relies on the Azure.Core and Azure.Resource.Manager libraries.\\r\\nFor detailed instructions on how to use the conversion tool, refer to the full [documentation](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/01-get-started/).\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e The conversion tool will not handle all scenarios - some manual conversion work may be required.\\n\\n### Validate the conversion\\n\\n1. Use the `tsp-client` compare tool: Run the following command to compare the original and converted specs:\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`bash\\r\\n    tsp-client compare --lhs openapi-specs-folder --rhs typespec-folder\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\r\\n    Parameters:\\r\\n    - `--lhs`: The folder containing your original hand-authored OpenAPI specifications.\\r\\n    - `--rhs`: The folder containing your converted TypeSpec files.\\r\\n2. Address any discrepancies or issues identified by the comparison tool. The command will ignore differences in the\\r\\nOpenAPI spec that don't correspond to differences in the service, allowing you to focus only on relevant differences.\\r\\n3. Disable SDK generation for OpenAPI: remove the specific language from the `swagger-to-sdk` list and delete the\\r\\n corresponding `readme.{language}.md` file. For example, to disable CSharp, remove `- repo: azure-sdk-for-net` from the\\r\\n `swagger-to-sdk` block in `readme.md` and delete `readme.csharp.md` file.\\r\\n Refer to [SDK generation configuration](xref:spec-gen-sdk-config) for more details of the configuration.\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Common post-conversion issues:\\r\\n\\u003e   - Datetime warnings: Ensure that datetime formats are consistent between the original and converted specs.\\r\\n\\u003e   - Casing issues: Verify that the casing of property names and other identifiers matches the original spec.\\n\\n### Create a pull request with your Azure REST API spec update\\n\\n1. Commit to your forked repository:\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`bash\\r\\n      git add .\\r\\n      git commit -m \\\"Converted OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec\\\"\\r\\n      git push origin main\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\r\\n2.

Switch to the `main` branch.\\r\\n2.

Copy the generated _docs_ directory (usually found under _sdk/\\u003cservice-directory\\u003e/\\u003clibrary\\u003e/build/docs_) to a\\r\\nsecondary location, like your local desktop.

You will need to follow the [Android guidelines](./sdk-android-docs.md)\\r\\n\\u003e for publishing said documentation instead.\\n\\n### Packages released through the Azure SDK engineering system\\n\\nIf your package is released through the Azure SDK engineering system, almost everything is automated. You'll need to\\r\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\r\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\r\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\r\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\r\\n*before* releasing.\\r\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\r\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\r\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\r\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\r\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays.

Find the Package-level overview using the table from [Package-level overviews](#package-level-overviews).\\r\\n2. Find the corresponding README.md file for the library in the SDK repo (e.g. [azure-sdk-for-net](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net)).\\r\\n3. Update the \\\"front matter\\\" date field at the beginning of the file to today's date. To update other front matter metadata, see [Ensure CSV metadata is correct](#ensure-csv-metadata-is-correct).\\r\\n4. Copy changed content from step 2 into the Package-level overview from step 1.\\r\\n5.

our previous 2 API releases (1 preview, 1 stable).  I've read through (lightly) the breaking change deep dive, which looks like I'll have to reach out to the review board to get their approval, however, I was wondering what is the recommended way to implement a fix for existing APIs, up to the point where it can be reviewed by ARM and Breaking changes board.\\\\nNormally, I would create a branch, commit a base version for review, then create a release plan against the new branch (then add in changes, get ARM sign off, then request the sdk release).\\\\nHow do I regenerate the SDKs once I have a fix in place for the previously released verisons?  Will they require manual updates (e.g. create a PR in each sdk repo with a fix)?\\\\nAny guidance would be appreciated!\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs (both preview and stable), you should follow a structured process that ensures compliance with Azure SDK and ARM review requirements, as well as proper handling of breaking changes:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Create a Release Branch and Plan**: Start by creating a dedicated release branch for your fix in the Azure REST API specs repository. Then, create a release plan in the Release Planner tool to track the work and ensure all steps are documented.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Implement the Fix**: Update the type specification in your API spec (TypeSpec or OpenAPI) on the release branch. Make sure the changes are isolated to the affected versions (preview and stable) and do not introduce unrelated changes.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Breaking Change Review**: Since this is a breaking change to a previously released API, you must email the Breaking Change Board (azbreakchangereview@microsoft.com) for approval. The ARM review board will also need to review your changes if this is a management plane API. Ensure your PR includes clear documentation of the change and its impact.\\\\n\\\\n4. **ARM Review and Approval**: Submit a pull request with your changes against the release branch. The ARM review board will review the PR. Address any feedback and obtain required approvals.\\\\n\\\\n5. **SDK Regeneration and Updates**:\\\\n   - Once the spec fix is merged, SDK generation pipelines will NOT automatically trigger for previously released versions. You will need to manually initiate SDK regeneration for each affected language and version.\\\\n   - For each SDK repo (.NET, Java, Python, JS/TS, Go), create a manual PR that updates the SDK to reflect the fixed type specification. This involves regenerating the SDK from the updated spec and pushing the changes to a new branch in each SDK repo.\\\\n   - Ensure you follow the standard SDK release process, including updating CHANGELOG.md, adding tests/samples as needed, and obtaining APIView approval for GA releases.\\\\n\\\\n6. **SDK Release**: After all manual PRs are reviewed and merged, run the release pipelines for each SDK to publish the updated packages. Make sure to approve only the relevant packages in the pipeline.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Breaking changes require explicit review and approval by ARM and the Breaking Change Board.\\\\n- SDKs for previously released versions must be manually regenerated and updated via PRs in each SDK repo.\\\\n- Use the Release Planner to track the process and ensure compliance with Azure SDK release guidelines.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need further help with the process or tooling, reach out via the provided Teams channels or email contacts.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs and regenerate SDKs, you should follow these steps:\\\\nFix the Spec and Follow Breaking Change Process: If your fix is a breaking change or a bug fix in an already released API version, you must submit a PR against the main branch of the public Azure REST API specs repository. If your PR is labeled with BreakingChangeReviewRequired or VersioningReviewRequired, you must get approval from the Breaking Change Review Board (see aka.ms/brch). For bug fixes, you may be able to apply the BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix label yourself, but the process should be strictly followed.\\\\nARM Review: Once the breaking change review is resolved, request ARM review.

Since you are working on a new preview API version and have generated the SDKs (autogenerated SDK API reviews), here is how you get these reviewed by the specific SDK teams:\nManagement Plane (ARM) SDKs Do NOT Require Arch Board Review:\nFor management plane (ARM) libraries like Azure Fleet, you do NOT need to schedule an SDK Architecture Board meeting. The review process is handled through the pull request (PR) workflow in the Azure REST API Specs repository.\nSDK Review Process for Your Scenario:\nAfter your REST API spec PR is approved and merged, the next steps are:\nEnsure you have a release plan created in the Azure SDK Release Planner.\nThe SDK generation and release planning will involve tracking the release plan milestones, where you can monitor which language SDKs are being generated and when they are ready for review.\nAssigning Specific SDK Teams as Reviewers:\nSDK teams are automatically assigned as reviewers for their respective language repos using the CODEOWNERS file in each SDK repository. If your service is not already listed in the CODEOWNERS file for a given language SDK repo, you should add your service and the appropriate GitHub users or teams to ensure SDK team visibility and review (see the reference for details).\nYou can also @-mention specific SDK team members in the generated SDK PRs in each language repository if you need urgent attention.\nHow to Track and Request Review:\nAfter the SDK PR is generated (either manually or via automation), monitor the PR in the respective SDK repo. The SDK team responsible for that language will review according to the CODEOWNERS assignment.\nIf you do not see timely review or need to escalate, reach out to the language-specific Teams channel or the SDK repo maintainers directly.\nSummary of Steps:\nConfirm your service is listed in the CODEOWNERS file for each SDK repo.\nCreate/track your release plan in the Azure SDK Release Planner.\nMonitor and follow up on the generated SDK PRs for reviews.\nFor Management Plane, no Arch Board meeting is needed; reviews are handled via the PR process.\nLet me know if you need guidance on updating CODEOWNERS or navigating the release planner!\nReferences below provide detailed steps and process links.", "inputs.response": "To get your autogenerated SDK API reviews (APIView links) reviewed by the appropriate SDK teams, you should ensure that the correct reviewers are automatically assigned via the CODEOWNERS file in the relevant SDK repository.

Address any discrepancies or issues identified by the comparison tool. The command will ignore differences in the\\r\\nOpenAPI spec that don't correspond to differences in the service, allowing you to focus only on relevant differences.\\r\\n3. Disable SDK generation for OpenAPI: remove the specific language from the `swagger-to-sdk` list and delete the\\r\\n corresponding `readme.{language}.md` file. For example, to disable CSharp, remove `- repo: azure-sdk-for-net` from the\\r\\n `swagger-to-sdk` block in `readme.md` and delete `readme.csharp.md` file.\\r\\n Refer to [SDK generation configuration](xref:spec-gen-sdk-config) for more details of the configuration.\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Common post-conversion issues:\\r\\n\\u003e   - Datetime warnings: Ensure that datetime formats are consistent between the original and converted specs.\\r\\n\\u003e   - Casing issues: Verify that the casing of property names and other identifiers matches the original spec.\\n\\n### Create a pull request with your Azure REST API spec update\\n\\n1.

For more information on TypeSpec Azure, visit [here](xref:api-typespec).\\r\\n[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) is the new standard API definition language for Azure, developed by Microsoft. It is an open-source tool designed to generate OpenAPI specifications and other API description languages. TypeSpec can also produce client code, with service code generation in progress. TypeSpec offers highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST patterns used for Azure.\\n\\n## Benefits of TypeSpec\\n\\n- **Consistency across APIs**: TypeSpec ensures consistency across APIs by using high-level templates, reducing the need for repetitive tasks and minimizing errors. This uniform design approach acts as a single source of truth for API definitions, enhancing both consistency and quality.\\r\\n- **Efficiency and speed**: TypeSpec significantly reduces the amount of code needed to define API specifications. A ten-line code snippet in TypeSpec can generate a hundred lines of an OpenAPI specification, drastically reducing manual effort.\\r\\n- **Enhanced tooling**: TypeSpec comes with advanced tools that catch errors early, leading to more robust APIs. Additionally, extensions for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespecvs) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespec-vscode) aid in efficient TypeSpec creation.\\r\\n- **Accessibility**: The compact nature of TypeSpec, combined with its familiar JavaScript-style syntax, allows even non-technical stakeholders to participate in the API review and design process.\\n\\n## Case Studies\\n\\nHear directly from teams who have successfully transitioned to TypeSpec Azure and learn about their experiences:\\n\\n### Azure Batch\\n\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EUkgwSc69lpPsBjQBfLfMEgB0WCTBe9x7ozU8VNK2s8mAw?e=1MIXZi)\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"There's definitions in Swagger, but … TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\"\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice.

How to get these reviewed by specific SDK teams?\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"To get your autogenerated SDK API reviews (APIView links) reviewed by the appropriate SDK teams, you should ensure that the correct reviewers are automatically assigned via the CODEOWNERS file in the relevant SDK repository. The Azure SDK and Azure REST API Specs GitHub repositories use the CODEOWNERS file to automatically add reviewers to PRs based on the service label and directory. \\\\n\\\\nHere's what you need to do:\\\\n\\\\n1. Locate the relevant block in the CODEOWNERS file for your service (e.g., Compute/Fleet) in the SDK repo (such as azure-sdk-for-net for .NET, azure-sdk-for-java for Java, etc.).\\\\n2. Update the GitHub aliases listed for your service to include the appropriate SDK team members or GitHub teams who should review the APIView links and SDK changes.\\\\n3. When your PR is opened or updated, these reviewers will be automatically assigned and notified to review the SDK API changes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to update who gets assigned or mentioned, follow the instructions in the CODEOWNERS documentation. This ensures that the right SDK teams are looped in for review and feedback.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have any issues or need further assistance, you can reach out via the Teams channel or email azsdkarch-help@microsoft.com for support.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Welcome to the TypeSpec and Azure SDK onboarding process! Since you are working on a new preview API version and have generated the SDKs (autogenerated SDK API reviews), here is how you get these reviewed by the specific SDK teams:\\\\nManagement Plane (ARM) SDKs Do NOT Require Arch Board Review:\\\\nFor management plane (ARM) libraries like Azure Fleet, you do NOT need to schedule an SDK Architecture Board meeting.

These branches are specifically designated for private onboarding and development before public release.\n- If your API spec is ready for public onboarding, you should use the public repo (azure-rest-api-specs) and target the 'main' branch.\n\nBranch protection errors typically occur if you attempt to merge directly into a protected branch (such as 'main' or 'RPSaaSMaster') without following the required process. The correct workflow is:\n1. Create a topic branch from the appropriate release branch (e.g., 'RPSaaSMaster' in private repo or 'main' in public repo).\n2. Submit your PR against the release branch, not directly against 'main' or 'RPSaaSMaster'.\n\nThis ensures compliance with branch protection rules and allows for proper review and CI validation.

Instead, create a topic branch off the release branch and submit your PR against it.\n\nSummary:\n- Use 'RPSaaSMaster' in azure-rest-api-specs-pr for private onboarding.\n- Use 'main' in azure-rest-api-specs for public onboarding.\n- Always create a topic branch from the release branch and submit your PR against the release branch, not directly into protected branches.\n\nIf you need more details on how to create and work against release branches, see the referenced onboarding documentation.", "inputs.context": "[{\"document_source\":\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\",\"document_filename\":\"docs#design#api-specs#api-typespec-conversion.md\",\"document_title\":\"Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec\",\"document_link\":\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec-conversion\",\"content\":\"# Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec\\n## Before you begin\\n# docs#design#api-specs#api-typespec-conversion.md\\n\\n# Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec\\n\\n## Before you begin\\n\\n- You have [access](xref:access) to the GitHub repositories and respective GitHub groups.\\r\\n- You read our [repository branches strategy](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_repobranching.html).\\r\\n- You are familiarized with the [Azure SDK Architecture design guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html).\\n\\n### Overview of TypeSpec\\n\\n[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) is the new standard API definition language for Azure, developed by Microsoft.\\r\\nTypeSpec offers many [benefits for Azure API definition](api-typespec.md), including consistency, efficiency, enhanced tooling,\\r\\nand accessibility.

It handles both data-plane\\r\\n and management-plane OpenAPI specs. The produced TypeSpec relies on the Azure.Core and Azure.Resource.Manager libraries.\\r\\nFor detailed instructions on how to use the conversion tool, refer to the full [documentation](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/01-get-started/).\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e The conversion tool will not handle all scenarios - some manual conversion work may be required.\\n\\n### Validate the conversion\\n\\n1. Use the `tsp-client` compare tool: Run the following command to compare the original and converted specs:\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`bash\\r\\n    tsp-client compare --lhs openapi-specs-folder --rhs typespec-folder\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\r\\n    Parameters:\\r\\n    - `--lhs`: The folder containing your original hand-authored OpenAPI specifications.\\r\\n    - `--rhs`: The folder containing your converted TypeSpec files.\\r\\n2. Address any discrepancies or issues identified by the comparison tool. The command will ignore differences in the\\r\\nOpenAPI spec that don't correspond to differences in the service, allowing you to focus only on relevant differences.\\r\\n3. Disable SDK generation for OpenAPI: remove the specific language from the `swagger-to-sdk` list and delete the\\r\\n corresponding `readme.{language}.md` file. For example, to disable CSharp, remove `- repo: azure-sdk-for-net` from the\\r\\n `swagger-to-sdk` block in `readme.md` and delete `readme.csharp.md` file.\\r\\n Refer to [SDK generation configuration](xref:spec-gen-sdk-config) for more details of the configuration.\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Common post-conversion issues:\\r\\n\\u003e   - Datetime warnings: Ensure that datetime formats are consistent between the original and converted specs.\\r\\n\\u003e   - Casing issues: Verify that the casing of property names and other identifiers matches the original spec.\\n\\n### Create a pull request with your Azure REST API spec update\\n\\n1. Commit to your forked repository:\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`bash\\r\\n      git add .\\r\\n      git commit -m \\\"Converted OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec\\\"\\r\\n      git push origin main\\r\\n    \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`\\r\\n2.

The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\r\\n1.

These branches are specifically designated for private onboarding and development before public release.\\\\n- If your API spec is ready for public onboarding, you should use the public repo (azure-rest-api-specs) and target the 'main' branch.\\\\n\\\\nBranch protection errors typically occur if you attempt to merge directly into a protected branch (such as 'main' or 'RPSaaSMaster') without following the required process. The correct workflow is:\\\\n1. Create a topic branch from the appropriate release branch (e.g., 'RPSaaSMaster' in private repo or 'main' in public repo).\\\\n2.
