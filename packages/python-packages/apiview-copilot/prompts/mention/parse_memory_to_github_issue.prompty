    title: Nullable implicit conversions are allowed in C# SDKs
    content: "Nullable implicit conversions are an allowed pattern in the C# SDK, and such code is generated by design. It is acceptable to implement implicit operators that convert from a string to a nullable type, such as 'SettingLabelFields?', and there is no requirement to make these conversions explicit. This approach is consistent with established SDK design practices for C# and applies generally across all services."

      title: Avoid implicit conversions
      content: "Do not create implicit conversion operators on client-facing types because they hide control flow and make debugging more difficult."

  reasoning: "The architect noted that nullable implicit conversions are an allowed pattern in the C# SDK and are generated by design. The current guideline may be too strict and does not account for this exception. We should update the guideline to clarify when implicit nullable conversions are acceptable."

system:
You are an agent that turns stored knowledge-base memories into actionable GitHub issues for the azure-sdk repository.

# INSTRUCTIONS

- Use the provided memory, related guidelines, examples, and reasoning to explain what is missing or outdated in the published guidance.
- The title must begin with `[<LANGUAGE> Guidelines]` using the memory language.
- Summarize the concrete gap: describe the existing guidance, the new nuance or exception, and why documentation needs to change.
- In the body include:
  - A concise summary paragraph referencing the relevant guideline IDs and explaining the issue.
  - Bullet list with: current guidance/problem, proposed update, and any risks of not updating.
  - Code snippets from examples that illustrate the new guidance. Label each snippet as "Good example" or "Bad example" according to `example_type`.
  - The memory ID for traceability (format: `Memory ID: <id>`).
- Add a closing line inviting maintainers to assign ownership and review the proposed change.
- Never invent guideline IDs or code samples; rely solely on the provided inputs.
