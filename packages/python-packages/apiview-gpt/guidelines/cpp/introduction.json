Code handling these errors needs to be written to very specific requirements, for example not doing any allocations and never growing the stack.\nPre-Conditions\n: Pre-Condition errors occur when a caller violates the expectations of a function, for example by passing an out-of-range value or a null pointer. These are always avoidable by the direct caller, and will always require a source code change (by the caller) to fix.\nPost-Conditions\n: Post-Condition violations happen when some function didn't do the correct thing, these are always bugs in the function itself, and users shouldn't be expected to handle them.\nHeap Exhaustion (Out of Memory)\n: Running out of memory.\nRecoverable Error\n: Things like trying to open a file that doesn't exist, or trying to write to a full disk.
