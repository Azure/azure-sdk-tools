{"testcase": "what's typespec", "query": "title: what's typespec\n\nquestion: what's typespec?", "ground_truth": "TypeSpec is a language and toolset developed by Microsoft for defining APIs and data models in a structured, reusable, and extensible way. It is similar to TypeScript in syntax, but is specifically designed for describing the shape and behavior of APIs (such as REST, gRPC, or GraphQL), not for general-purpose programming.\nTypeSpec allows you to:\nDefine the interface of your API, including operations, request/response models, and error handling.\nGenerate artifacts such as OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications, SDKs, and documentation from a single source of truth.\nEnforce API design consistency and reduce errors, especially in large organizations or when following strict guidelines (like Azure's API standards).\nReuse and extend models and patterns using TypeSpec libraries and templates.\nFor Azure, TypeSpec has dedicated extensions and libraries that help you follow Azure API guidelines and make it easier to build ARM (Azure Resource Manager) and data-plane services. Using TypeSpec leads to APIs that are easier to review, more consistent, and better supported by tooling.\nYou can get started by installing the TypeSpec CLI and using templates to quickly scaffold a project.

Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\n```\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: string;\n// ... other properties ...\n}\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: \"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\";\nrecoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\nAction Items:\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.", "context": "", "response_length": 2139}
