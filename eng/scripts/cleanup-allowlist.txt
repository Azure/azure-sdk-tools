# Exclude child resource groups created by Azure resources.
# These often have locks/permissions that explicitly deny being able to be manually deleted.
# The groups get cleaned up when their parent group is deleted.
# For example, Azure Synapse (synapseworkspace-managedrg-adaed0ea-df22-4ec1-9280-5ac85cf2f87a) and Azure Purview (managed-rg-mypurviewaccount).
