    "comment": "You must have an async client named `WidgetClient` in the azure.widget.aio namespace.",
    "source": "guideline"
  }
response:
  action: DISCARD
  rationale: The comment asserts that an async client named 'WidgetClient' is missing in the azure.widget.aio namespace, but the outline clearly shows that WidgetClient exists in that namespace. This violates the additional exception rule that requires discarding comments that claim elements are absent when they are present in the outline.
