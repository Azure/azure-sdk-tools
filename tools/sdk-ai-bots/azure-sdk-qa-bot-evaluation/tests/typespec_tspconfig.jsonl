We were hoping to onboard to SDK later.\nI'm a bit confused. Does api approval always include SDK? If not, how do we setup tspconfig to validate.\nwe are creating an arm api / not dataplane. I've seen some tspconfig.yaml without sdk configs, but when i try removing them I encounter tsv failures.", "ground_truth": "As of today how the system is designed, you need to suppress those warning if you do not want to include SDK at this time.
