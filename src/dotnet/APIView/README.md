## What is this for?

APIView is meant to streamline the API design review process by concisely displaying public contents and supporting collaborative review. Rather than showing all contents of uploaded APIs, only public and protected members will be displayed - additionally, method implementations are hidden. The intent of this is to focus design review on the API features users will interact with while making review of structure and naming conventions as streamlined as possible.
