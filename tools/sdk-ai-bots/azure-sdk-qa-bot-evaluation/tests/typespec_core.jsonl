{"testcase": "Playground usage", "query": "title: Playground usage\n\nquestion: Hi,\nQuestion on usage of the playground at https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground . When we are putting together something to use as an example for a new addition of a child proxy resource to our spec we get import errors. This is because we are importing from a common model files.\nIs it possible to add files or somehow scope a playground so its context is our existing specification so it imports the references correctly.  For example our spec is in \\specification\\netapp\\resource-manager\\Microsoft.NetApp\\NetApp that includes models.tsp file.\nCan we create a playground that would resolve something like import \"./../models.tsp\";", "ground_truth": "There is no a 'remote import' feature in the typespec azure playground.", "context": "", "response_length": 71}
