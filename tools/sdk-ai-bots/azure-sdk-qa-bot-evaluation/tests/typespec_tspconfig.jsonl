{"testcase": "is sdk generation required for private preview?", "query": "title: is sdk generation required for private preview?\n\nquestion: we are trying to get our api approved for a private preview, but our preview customers do not require an SDK. We were hoping to onboard to SDK later.\nI'm a bit confused. Does api approval always include SDK? If not, how do we setup tspconfig to validate.\nwe are creating an arm api / not dataplane. I've seen some tspconfig.yaml without sdk configs, but when i try removing them I encounter tsv failures.", "ground_truth": "API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\n\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\n\nThe correct and supported approach is:\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\n\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\n```\n\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\n\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation in tspconfig.yaml until you are ready to onboard SDKs.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "SDK generation configuration", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-spec-gen-sdk-config"}, {"title": "How to generate client libraries", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/00howtogen"}, {"title": "Repo setup", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-with-tsp-client/repo_setup"}, {"title": "Migrate ARM spec", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/checklists/migrate-arm-tips"}, {"title": "Usage", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-with-tsp-client/intro_tsp_client"}, {"title": "SDK Validation steps are failing with not much helpful logs", "link": ""}, {"title": "Namespaces", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/http-client-python/reference/package-structure"}, {"title": "TypeSpec AutoRest Library", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/emitters/typespec-autorest/index"}, {"title": "Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec-conversion"}, {"title": "Rules", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation"}, {"title": "Table of Contents", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/SDK-Validation"}, {"title": "Configuration", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/configuration/configuration"}, {"title": "Rules", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation"}, {"title": "SdkTspConfigValidation failures for JS dataplane code generation", "link": ""}, {"title": "Create a pull request with your Azure REST API spec update", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-specs-pr"}, {"title": "Client Emitters", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/introduction"}, {"title": "Client Emitters", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/introduction"}, {"title": "Installation", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/introduction/installation"}, {"title": "Generating readme and examples files", "link": ""}, {"title": "Azure REST API Specification Directory Structure", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Specification-Folder-Structure-Guide"}, {"title": "API versions and branches", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-versions-and-branches"}, {"title": "After migration - in data-plane/DynamicSessions/tspconfig.yaml", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Resolving-Folder-Migration-Conflicts:-A-Guide-for-PR-Authors"}, {"title": "ARM PR Typespec validation - GitHub CI fails but succeeds locally", "link": ""}, {"title": "Azure Service Versioning Guide", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Azure-Service-Versioning-Guideline"}, {"title": "Can required fields have default values?", "link": ""}, {"title": "API versions and branches", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-versions-and-branches"}, {"title": "Typespec Validation required check", "link": ""}], "expected_references": [{"title": "API version lifecycle stages", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-versions-and-branches"}, {"title": "SDK generation configuration", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-spec-gen-sdk-config"}, {"title": "Migrate ARM spec", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/checklists/migrate-arm-tips"}, {"title": "Azure REST API Specification Directory Structure", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Specification-Folder-Structure-Guide"}]}
