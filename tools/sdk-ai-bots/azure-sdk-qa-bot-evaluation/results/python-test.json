            "answer": "The SSL certificate verification error you are seeing during live testing of async APIs is a common issue when the test proxy is configured to use HTTPS (e.g., PROXY_URL='https://localhost:5001'). This error typically occurs because the test proxy's self-signed certificate is not trusted by your environment, especially in async test scenarios.\n\nTo resolve this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Update your branch to main**: Make sure your branch includes the latest changes from the main branch. The test proxy's certificate is occasionally rotated, and having the latest version ensures you have the correct certificate.\n\n2. **Default to HTTP if possible**: If your tests do not specifically require an HTTPS proxy endpoint, unset the PROXY_URL environment variable or set it to the default HTTP endpoint (http://localhost:5000). HTTP does not require certificate verification and avoids this issue entirely.\n\n   Example:\n   ```sh\n   unset PROXY_URL\n   # or in Windows\n   set PROXY_URL=\n   ```\n\n3. **If HTTPS is required**: If your tests must use HTTPS and you continue to see this error (especially for async tests), this is likely due to async-specific certificate handling issues that can be nondeterministic. In this case, reach out to the Azure SDK team for further assistance, as the certificate is supposed to be automatically configured but may fail in certain async environments.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Prefer using HTTP for the test proxy unless HTTPS is strictly required.\n- If HTTPS is required and you still see the error after updating your branch, contact the Azure SDK team for support.\n\nFor more details and troubleshooting steps, see the official guidance in the references below.",

            "answer": "The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\nHere are practical steps:\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\n```\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\nsphinx = false\n```",

            "answer": "To resolve Sphinx docstring errors and warnings (such as unexpected indentation, block quote issues, and duplicate explicit target names) in the emitted Python SDK, you need to ensure that the TypeSpec comments and descriptions for your models and unions are formatted in a way that produces valid reStructuredText (reST) when rendered as Python docstrings. The Python emitter translates TypeSpec comments directly into docstrings, so any formatting issues in the TypeSpec will propagate to Sphinx.\n\n**Key steps to resolve your issues:**\n\n1. **Bulleted/Definition Lists and Blank Lines:**\n   - In TypeSpec comments, always add a blank line before and after bulleted lists, block quotes, or definition lists. Sphinx/reST requires these blank lines to parse the structure correctly.\n   - Example (in TypeSpec):\n     ```\n     /// Description of the property.\n     ///\n     /// - Item 1\n     /// - Item 2\n     ///\n     ```\n\n2. **Indentation:**\n   - Ensure that all lines in multi-line comments are consistently indented. Avoid mixing tabs and spaces, and do not add extra indentation unless you are intentionally creating a code block.\n   - For block quotes or code blocks, use a blank line before and after, and indent the block consistently.\n\n3. **Duplicate Explicit Target Names:**\n   - This usually happens when the same link text (e.g., \"learn more\") is used multiple times in the same docstring. In TypeSpec, avoid repeating the same reference label in multiple places within the same comment block. If you need to reference the same link, use different labels or avoid explicit targets.\n\n4. **Union Types (like ServiceTier):**\n   - For unions of string literals, the Python emitter generates a `Union[Literal[...], str]` type. If you add a docstring to the union, ensure that any bulleted list of values is separated by blank lines and does not have extra indentation.\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     /// Service tier options:\n     ///\n     /// - \"auto\"\n     /// - \"default\"\n     /// - \"flex\"\n     /// - \"scale\"\n     /// - \"priority\"\n     ///\n     union ServiceTier {\n       \"auto\",\n       \"default\",\n       \"flex\",\n       \"scale\",\n       \"priority\",\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Model Docstrings (like Response):**\n   - Review all comments on properties and the model itself. Ensure that any lists, code blocks, or references are properly separated by blank lines and do not have duplicate link targets.\n   - If you are inheriting or spreading models (e.g., `...Response_Pre_Update`), check the parent model's comments as well.\n\n6. **Testing Locally:**\n   - After making changes, regenerate the SDK and run Sphinx locally using the recommended command:\n     ```\n     tox run -e sphinx -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root .\n     ```\n   - This will help you catch docstring issues before pushing changes.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Update your TypeSpec comments to follow reST/Sphinx formatting rules: blank lines around lists/blocks, consistent indentation, and unique link targets.\n- Regenerate the SDK and re-run Sphinx to verify the issues are resolved.\n\nIf you need more concrete examples, refer to the [Azure SDK Python docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md) for best practices.\n\nIf you still see issues after these changes, please share the specific TypeSpec comment blocks for further review.",
