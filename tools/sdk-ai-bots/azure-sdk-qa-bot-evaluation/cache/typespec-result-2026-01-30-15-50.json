ARM does support async PATCH operations, although REST API Guidelines discourage async PATCH operations.  If this operation is synchronous in the previous stable version, then this change is a real breaking change that you will need to justify in breaking change review.\nSimilarly, making PUT and DELETE Asynchronous is a breaking change if these operations were synchronous in the previous stable version is a real breaking change, and you will need to justify the change in a breaking change review.",

            "answer": "Your understanding regarding the breaking change flag for the readonly 'provisioningState' field in the PATCH operation model is correct: removing or not including a readonly field like 'provisioningState' from the PATCH request model (e.g., ConfigurationPropertiesUpdate) should NOT be considered a breaking change. According to Azure and ARM guidelines, readonly properties are not updatable and should not appear in PATCH request bodies. The PATCH model should only include properties that are updatable; readonly fields are only present in responses. If the breaking change tooling is flagging this as a removal, it is a false positive and can be safely ignored for readonly fields in PATCH request models.\n\nFor your second question about converting create, update, and delete (CUD) operations to long-running operations (LRO) in a new API version:\n- Changing CUD operations to LRO in a new API version is allowed and is the recommended approach when new business requirements (like provisioning MRG) require asynchronous processing. This is not considered a breaking change for previous API versions, as long as the change is only present in the new API version and the old versions remain synchronous.\n- The correct way to implement this in TypeSpec is to use the appropriate Azure Resource Manager LRO operation templates (e.g., ArmCreateOrReplaceAsync, ArmResourcePatchAsync, ArmResourceDeleteAsync) for the new API version. You should use @sharedRoute and @renamedFrom/@removed decorators to ensure the old and new operations are properly versioned and routed, so that clients using older versions continue to see the synchronous behavior, while clients using the new version get the LRO behavior.\n\nSummary of recommended actions:\n1. Do NOT include readonly fields like 'provisioningState' in PATCH request models; ignore breaking change flags for their removal in PATCH models.\n2. For new API versions, use the ARM LRO operation templates for CUD operations and version your operations using @sharedRoute and @renamedFrom/@removed decorators to avoid breaking changes for older versions.\n\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure API guidelines and ARM resource provider contract requirements.",

This is important in scenarios such as:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An update to a dependency or sub-dependency introduces an unexpected breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Updates to a new version of a service should not impact older versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Modifications are made to the TypeSpec specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese issues can be mitigated with a few precautionary measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Defend against dependency changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: This section applies if using `tsp install` or `npm install` to install dependencies. However other package managers (`yarn`, `pnpm`, etc.) have their own similar lock mechanisms._\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen using `tsp install` or `npm install` a `package-lock.json` will be installed. This file SHOULD be committed to source control. It will ensure that later calls to `tsp install` or `npm install` will use the exact versions resolved in the lock files unless the `package.json` was updated or a command like `npm update` was run.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe command `npm ci` can also be used in the CI to ensure that the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are in sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Work with multiple versions of a service\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a library `@typespec/versioning` that can be used to describe changes to a service or library over time. Using this will ensure that a service can evolve while keeping track of the changes and allowing emitters to see the service representation at different versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[See versioning docs](../libraries/versioning/reference/index.mdx)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Change to the TypeSpec spec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you don't directly control the spec, you might still want to make sure you remember which exact definition was used.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUsing version control and pinning to a specific commit SHA will ensure that the spec will remain exactly as it was.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Summary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

The big change to our typespec definition is that we will be moving most of the request properties from query parameters to the request body.  In 3.0, the only property in the request body was an array of InputTextItem.  InputTextItem is just a string.  All the other relevant data was passed in as query parameters. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn 2025-05-01-preview, we want to add a number of additional properties to the request body, so rather than the body consisting of InputTextItem, we want the body to contain a TranslateBody definition, which in turn contains all of our properties.  I'm not sure how to represent this in the tsp files in a compliant way.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOur translate operation in the routes.tsp file is \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop translate is CustomOperation\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n InputTextItem[],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslateParameters,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslationResult,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n ErrorResponse\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u003e; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe first member of the template is the request body and I need it to be InputTextItem[] for 3.0 and I need it to be TranslateBody for 2025-05-01-preview.  Otherwise one of them will have the wrong set of arguments.  I considered simply updating InputTextItem to contain all the needed parameters in TranslateBody and then removing the unused ones with @added decorators, but the problem is we have a number of other operators in 2025-05-01-preview which use InputTextItem and require it to be just the text string.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there anyway to have two different translate operations such that one is called by 3.0 and one is called by 2025-05-01-preview?

Service owners should plan for at least 6-8 weeks (about 2 months) for the process to be completed. Here are the process steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 1. Intake Preparation (Owner: Service PM)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1-3 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Create a new intake using the template for breaking changes: \\\\\\\\u003chttps://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/create/Scenario?templateld=c815af37-5520-43ff-90c8-d985eaabcb6c\\\\\\\\u0026ownerld=85bb92fb-21fe-41ca-9309-47f2c5f57515\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Save Intake Request as New.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Please assign the intake to the service owner PM.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Breaking Change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Please ensure your request shows up in the dashboard (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_dashboards/dashboard/f7db6895-7137-4695-b3f5-00dc4d36758f\\\\\\\\u003e)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Send email to @azbreakchangereview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Attend weekly Office Hours to talk through the breaking change and seek approval. The office hours are on Mondays, 10 AM to 11 AM Pacific Time. Meeting details can be found here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 2. Intake Evaluation (Owner: Service PM/Breaking Change review board)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1-2 weeks\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Validate high-level business justification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- What is the proposal that is being reviewed?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Why do you need this breaking change?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- What will your team do if the breaking change is not approved? There is a high chance the breaking change will NOT be approved.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Customer experience impact.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Number of customers affected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- How can you reduce the impact on customers?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 3. Intake decision (Owner: Breaking change Review Board)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1-3 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Reviewing all the information, the Breaking Change Review Board will decide whether to approve the proposal, change it, or disapprove it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 4. Intake approval from Azure REST API board (Owner: Service PM)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 1 week\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Once approved by the Breaking Change Review Board, status of the intake will be marked as approved by the Breaking Change Review Board.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- If there is an SDK impact- then the proposal should be reviewed by API board to seek approval. Reference the API Breaking change documentation: \\\\\\\\u003chttps://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/Guidelines.md#api-changes-that-require-a-version-change\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage the SDK team and the SDK Review board to minimize the impact on client libraries.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Service teams should not implement the change until all approvals have been received.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### 5. Communication Readiness (Owner: Service PM/Azure Marketing/CSS)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Estimated time:** 2-6 weeks\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Service team owners will need to work with Azure PMM/ Service PM/ Sharon Loh (Breaking change Team - Marketing) - to lock on communication template. If breaking change impacts more than 20,000 subscription IDs, the customer email will be reviewed by assigned editorial team and needs marketing GM and at least one marketing CVP approval. This process will take 2 to 4 weeks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage MS DOC team to update content.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage Business planning team to update price, if appropriate\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage assigned Azure PMM to update marketing assets and ACOM.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Engage Comms Team for avoiding negative press.

Versioning allows you to manage changes to your API over time without breaking existing clients. We'll introduce the `@versioned` decorator, show how to define versions with enums, and demonstrate how to use the `@added` decorator to specify version-specific models and operations.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy V1.3.2.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy V1.3.2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy V1.3.2\\\\\\\\n## 5.

Any new fields must be removed when responding to an old client. Also, old clients may update the resource which may delete fields added by a newer client. For version/state resiliency, we recommend using PATCH (with JSON merge patch) instead of PUT (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFK6RRTwXCg\\\\\\\\u003e).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Changing a resource's field constraints is also problematic. For example: Changing a string's maximum length is a breaking change because a new client could set a long string and an old client can't get/set it back.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document informs Azure service teams of the impact to customers when making service changes and versioning. For more information, please see this video (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG984__6dSO\\\\\\\\u0026list=PL9XzOCngAkqs4m0XdULJu_78nM3Ok3Q65\\\\\\\\u0026index=14\\\\\\\\u003e).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe two tables below describe what kind of changes a service can make in a new api-version or after a breaking change review. The tables focus on service API contracts, are not exhaustive, and do not address service behavior changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure requires that any API contract change requires a new api-version; some footnotes (below) allow a few exceptions here. Failure to change the service's API contract without a new api-version can cause confusion especially if the new features are not rolled out to all clouds before documented to users. Here are some examples that cause confusion (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG984_L6dSO\\\\\\\\u0026list=PL9XzOCngAkqs4m0XdULJu_78nM3Ok3Q65\\\\\\\\u0026index=14\\\\\\\\u003e):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Customers can't tell from a specific api-version's documentation whether it includes a new feature or not.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Azure support can't know if an api-version honors a new feature or not to help customers.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Customers can tell if a version of an SDK client library supports a new feature or not.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSome additional notes about the sections below:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Renaming a query parameter/header/field is equivalent to removing it and adding a new one. So, renames are always considered breaking and must be avoided.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Changing a resource's schema (which spans all api-versions) must be taken with great care. Any new fields must be removed when responding to an old client. Also, old clients may update the resource which may delete fields added by a newer client. For version/state resiliency, we recommend using PATCH (with JSON merge patch) instead of PUT (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFK6RRTwXCg\\\\\\\\u003e).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Changing a resource's field constraints is also problematic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Table 1: Changes requiring a new api-version of the service\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Change | Why this change is non-breaking for old clients |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|--------|------------------------------------------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add an extensible enum (string) value | Clients see this as a string value.

Retirements must be discussed with Azure Retirements Reviewers (\\\\\\\\u003chttps://dev.azure.com/msazure/AzureWiki/_wiki/wikis/AzureWiki.wiki/88597/Azure-Retirement-Policy-and-Process\\\\\\\\u003e). Based on the outcome this breaking change may be doable in a new api-version of the service. And, in some extreme cases, this breaking change may be doable in an existing api-version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**NOTE:** These changes are strongly discouraged:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change | Why this change is breaking for old clients |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add pagination support | Old client expects response to include all results and will only ever see 1st page |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add required input | Old client doesn't send this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove input/output | Old client always sends/expects this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add new output enum value | Old client will crash when deserializing |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove input/output enum value | Old client sends/expects this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove extensible enum (string) value\\\\u00b2 | Old client sends/expects this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change input from optional to required | Old clients don't send this |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change output from optional to required | New client doesn't expect nullable field (for some language SDKs) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change input/output required to optional | Client code stops compiling due to change in SDK method parameters |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change case (ex: RBAC to Rbac) | Old client sends wrong case |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change format (ex: minutes to time) | Old client can't parse new format |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change data type (ex: bool to string) | Old client can't parse new type's value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Widen input integer (ex: Int32 to Int64) | Old client doesn't expect larger value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Widen output integer (ex: Int32 to Int64) | Old client loses precision |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Narrow input/output integer (ex: Int64 to Int32) | New service loses precision |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Strengthen input constraint (ex: max value 5 to 4) | Old client sends bigger value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Weaken output constraint (ex: max value 5 to 6) | Old client gets value it never expected |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change default value | Old client doesn't expect new default behavior |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change discriminator field value | Old client doesn't expect/send new value |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Change input parameter order in swagger | Client code stops compiling due to change in SDK method parameter order |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Remove body Content-Type (ex: application/json) | Old client doesn't expect request to fail |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Add response code |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI am reaching out to seek advice about versioning the LRO header: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Define contract for Batch RuleSet feature by mangoo1 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #37879 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-s\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/37879)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nis about to extend an existing RuleSet PUT endpoint to allow it accepting an optional request body, the feature would be turned on when we specify a bool flag to true and the PUT endpoint would be extend to 201 LRO.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis behavior would be available on the new ApiVersion, so I would like to put the Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia annotation to the new ApiVersion, along with LRO/Async headers ArmAsyncOperationHeader\\\\\\\\u003cFinalResult = RuleSet\\\\\\\\u003e and ArmLroLocationHeader\\\\\\\\u003cFinalResult = RuleSet\\\\\\\\u003e.

Property names using the `?` are optional properties, which may or may not be provided in the request body for CreateOrUpdate (PUT) requests.

Notice that the model uses built-in scalar types like `string` and `int32`, new types built from scalar types with added constraints, like `Password` and `EmployeeLevel`, enumerations of values, like `EmployeeProvisioningState`, and complex types. The individual components of this model are described below.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that _documentation comments on all models and model properties are required when specs are checked in_. Here they are omitted for clarity. The TypeSpec compiler and TypeSpec IDE tooling will emit warning diagnostics if you emit required documentation, and about most of the ARM rules described in this document.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### The `provisioningState` Property for Tracked Resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll Tracked Resources are required to implement a 'provisioningState' property in their rp-specific property bag. This is used by ARM and some ARM clients to track the provisioning state of a resource as it is created and deleted. At minimum, the provisioning state must contain the standard terminal values that ARM is looking for. There are contained in the `ResourceProvisioningState` enumeration in the Azure.ResourceManager library. If RPs have other provisioning states they would like to track, they can define their own provisioning state enum, and mix in the value, as shown in the sample above, or they may simply use the standard provisioning state as shown in the sample below:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ResourceProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that this example uses the spread operator `...`, which allows you to simply include the properties from a source model in the target model you are constructing. This has the effect of copying the properties of the source model and their decorations into the target model, without creating any nominal inheritance relationship.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternately, this is also equivalent:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ResourceProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The status of the last provisioning operation performed on the resource. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningState?: ResourceProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Required and Optional properties and Property Defaults\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the examples, note that some model properties use the optional operator `?` after the property name, like `biography?` and some do not, like `title`. Property names using the `?` are optional properties, which may or may not be provided in the request body for CreateOrUpdate (PUT) requests. Property names without the `?` are required properties, which must be provided in PUT requests. The exception is that properties that have 'readOnly' visibility do not appear in requests, but may be required or optional in responses.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso note that optional properties may specify defaults, as with `biography?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No biography provided\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. The default indicates the value that will be recorded on the server if no value is sent by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Defining Custom Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the sample, new constrained scalar types and new complex model types are defined and used inside the _rp-specific property bag_. TypeSpec allows you to define custom types for use in your specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will often want to define scalar types or properties that have constraints. For example, numeric values may be constrained to have a certain minimum or maximum, strign values may be constrained to follow a particular regex pattern, and so on. Whenever these constrained types are used in your spec, the constraints will be transmitted to the usage.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe example creates a numeric type with minimum and maximum constraints:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@minValue(50)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@maxValue(70)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeLevel extends int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis defines 'EmployeeLevel' as an integer value between 50 and 70. The example also defines a complex type used in an array:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Job {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  companyName: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  start: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  end: plainDate;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  role: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  notes?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMode details on what to consider when using complex types in an array are discussed in the section on [modeling arrays of complex types](#modeling-arrays-of-complex-types).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Using Resource identifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is often the case that resources need to reference other resources to provide specific pieces of functionality. For example, resources may need to reference a storage account to use for storing user data, or a NIC to attach to a Network. The `Azure.ResourceManager` library defines a `ResourceIdentifier` template that allows you to easily represent references to resources in your API. The template allows you to specify one or more acceptable resource types, automatically designating the value as a resource reference, and providing the appropriate pattern validation - which helps in generating better code, better ARM templates, and better documentation for your API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar EmployeeResourceId\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends Azure.Core.armResourceIdentifier\\\\\\\\u003c[\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.HR/employees\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nscalar NetworkInterfaceId\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends Azure.Core.armResourceIdentifier\\\\\\\\u003c[\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/networkInterfaces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `NetworkInterfaceId example shows how to allow multiple resource types in a reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Property Visibility and Other Constraints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sample uses the `@visibility` decorator to indicate how the resource definition is used in requests to PUT and PATCH operations, and in responses to PUT, PATCH, GET, and LIST operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis table shows how visibility is used to determine whether a property is used in requests and responses:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Visibility           | In Create Request? | In Patch Request/ Updateable in PUT | In Responses | Sample                                         |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| None                 | Yes                | Yes                                 | Yes          | Most properties                                |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read, create, update | Yes                | Yes                                 | Yes          | Most properties                                |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read, create         | Yes                | No                                  | Yes          | resource location                              |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read, update         | No                 | Yes                                 | Yes          | Properties only settable after creation (keys) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| create, update       | Yes                | Yes                                 | No           | Secrets (e.g. password)                        |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| read                 | No                 | No                                  | Yes          | Calculated properties, e.g. provisioning\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM.Legacy.Extension-Operations-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.Extension Operations Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.Extension Operations Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 3.

My team (Microsoft Translator) is trying to update our POST translate call with a breaking change.  The PR is: [Update translate call to 2025-05-01 by SG-MS \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #33410 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/33410) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe old version (3.0) is being updated to a new version (2025-05-01-preview).  The big change to our typespec definition is that we will be moving most of the request properties from query parameters to the request body.  In 3.0, the only property in the request body was an array of InputTextItem.  InputTextItem is just a string.  All the other relevant data was passed in as query parameters. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn 2025-05-01-preview, we want to add a number of additional properties to the request body, so rather than the body consisting of InputTextItem, we want the body to contain a TranslateBody definition, which in turn contains all of our properties.  I'm not sure how to represent this in the tsp files in a compliant way.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOur translate operation in the routes.tsp file is \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop translate is CustomOperation\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n InputTextItem[],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslateParameters,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslationResult,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n ErrorResponse\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u003e; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe first member of the template is the request body and I need it to be InputTextItem[] for 3.0 and I need it to be TranslateBody for 2025-05-01-preview.  Otherwise one of them will have the wrong set of arguments.  I considered simply updating InputTextItem to contain all the needed parameters in TranslateBody and then removing the unused ones with @added decorators, but the problem is we have a number of other operators in 2025-05-01-preview which use InputTextItem and require it to be just the text string.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there anyway to have two different translate operations such that one is called by 3.0 and one is called by 2025-05-01-preview?

According to Azure and ARM guidelines, readonly properties are not updatable and should not appear in PATCH request bodies. The PATCH model should only include properties that are updatable; readonly fields are only present in responses. If the breaking change tooling is flagging this as a removal, it is a false positive and can be safely ignored for readonly fields in PATCH request models.\\\\n\\\\nFor your second question about converting create, update, and delete (CUD) operations to long-running operations (LRO) in a new API version:\\\\n- Changing CUD operations to LRO in a new API version is allowed and is the recommended approach when new business requirements (like provisioning MRG) require asynchronous processing. This is not considered a breaking change for previous API versions, as long as the change is only present in the new API version and the old versions remain synchronous.\\\\n- The correct way to implement this in TypeSpec is to use the appropriate Azure Resource Manager LRO operation templates (e.g., ArmCreateOrReplaceAsync, ArmResourcePatchAsync, ArmResourceDeleteAsync) for the new API version. You should use @sharedRoute and @renamedFrom/@removed decorators to ensure the old and new operations are properly versioned and routed, so that clients using older versions continue to see the synchronous behavior, while clients using the new version get the LRO behavior.\\\\n\\\\nSummary of recommended actions:\\\\n1. Do NOT include readonly fields like 'provisioningState' in PATCH request models; ignore breaking change flags for their removal in PATCH models.\\\\n2. For new API versions, use the ARM LRO operation templates for CUD operations and version your operations using @sharedRoute and @renamedFrom/@removed decorators to avoid breaking changes for older versions.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure API guidelines and ARM resource provider contract requirements.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The 'provisioningState' change in the PATCH request model seems like a bug fix if this field was always read-only.  When you get a breaking change review, if this is explained with an appropriate comment, this is likely to be justified as a bug fix.\\\\nOn changing PATCH to synchronous.  ARM does support async PATCH operations, although REST API Guidelines discourage async PATCH operations.  If this operation is synchronous in the previous stable version, then this change is a real breaking change that you will need to justify in breaking change review.\\\\nSimilarly, making PUT and DELETE Asynchronous is a breaking change if these operations were synchronous in the previous stable version is a real breaking change, and you will need to justify the change in a breaking change review.\\\"}\"}]",

The decorator should indicate that starting from v2, the parameter type changed from model1 to model2. Your current usage incorrectly states that the change happened in v1, which causes the error because model2 does not exist in v1.\n\nHere is the corrected TypeSpec code:\n\n```typespec\n@added(v1)\nmodel1;\n\n@added(v2)\nmodel2;\n\n@added(v1)\nfeatureA {\n  @typeChangedFrom(v2, model1)\n  body: model2;\n}\n```\n\nThis tells TypeSpec that in v2, the type of 'body' changed from model1 (used in v1) to model2 (introduced in v2). This pattern is compliant with Azure API versioning best practices and will resolve the error you encountered.",

To achieve this, you can use a combination of `@removed`, `@added`, and `@renamedFrom` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2,

and Making Another Parameter Optional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario shows how to add a parameter and make another optional in an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following operation in v1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Make the `location` header parameter optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add a new optional query parameter `orderBy`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can achieve this using the `@madeOptional` and `@added` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @query(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order-by\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      orderBy?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@madeOptional(Versions.v2)` makes `location` optional starting in v2.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the `orderBy` query parameter in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario illustrates converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one across versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following synchronous operation in `v1`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you update this operation to be asynchronous as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdateV1 is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@removed(Versions.v2)` removes the original synchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` keeps the original name for v1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the new asynchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@sharedRoute` ensures both operations can use the same route.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#05-authentication.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Authentication\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/05-authentication\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"#

With recent updates, you can now reference types defined in external namespaces or imported libraries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example: Referencing an External Type\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuppose you want your generated client library to use a type from an external package instead of the default emitted type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@alternateType(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    fullyQualifiedName: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externallib.ExternalModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    package: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"externallib\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel MyModel {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  prop: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, instead of generating `MyModel` in the Python sdk, the emitter will reference `ExternalModel` from `externallib` instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Use Cases\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Integrating with shared types from other services or libraries.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Ensuring consistency across multiple SDKs by reusing common models.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Reducing duplication when types are already defined elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Notes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- The referenced type should be compatible with the intended usage in the generated client library.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#generate-client-libraries#08types.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Generated Types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Generated Types\\\\\\\\n## Client Default Values (Legacy)\\\\\\\\n# howtos#generate-client-libraries#08types.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Generated Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Client Default Values (Legacy)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n:::caution\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `@clientDefaultValue` decorator is legacy functionality that should **only** be used to mitigate SDK breaking changes for brownfield services. **New services should NOT use this decorator.** Instead, use standard TypeSpec patterns for default values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.Legacy.clientDefaultValue` decorator allows you to set a client-level default value for a model property or operation parameter.

This decorator allows you to specify the versions that your API supports and manage changes across these versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example: Defining API Versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet's define two versions of our API, `v1` and `v2`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp title=main.tsp tryit=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"emit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/openapi3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-next-line\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-next-line\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pet Store\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@server(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://example.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Single server endpoint\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-next-line\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace PetStore;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-start\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// highlight-end\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We're importing and using a new module, `@typespec/versioning`, which provides versioning support.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `@versioned` decorator is used to define the versions supported by the API, defined in the `Versions` enum.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `Versions` enum specifies two versions: `v1` (1.0) and `v2` (2.0).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Generating OpenAPI Specifications for Different Versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce versions are added, the TypeSpec compiler generates individual OpenAPI specifications for each version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{/* prettier-ignore */}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cFileTree\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- package.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- node_modules/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- tsp-output/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - @typespec/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - openapi3\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      - openapi.1.0.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      - openapi.2.0.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c/FileTree\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGenerating separate specs for each version ensures backward compatibility, provides clear documentation for developers to understand differences between versions, and simplifies maintenance by allowing independent updates to each version's specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBy encapsulating different versions of the API within the context of the same TypeSpec project, we can manage all versions in a unified manner. This approach makes it easier to maintain consistency, apply updates, and ensure that all versions are properly documented and aligned with the overall API strategy.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning\\\\\\\\n## Adding the Versioning Library\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Adding the Versioning Library\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore we can use the versioning decorators, we need to add the `@typespec/versioning` library to our project. This involves updating the `package.json` file and installing the necessary dependencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Step 1: Update `package.json`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdd the `@typespec/versioning` library to your `package.json` file, in both the `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies` sections. Your updated `package.json` should look like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":

However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#typespec-client-generator-core#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Decorators\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ClientGenerator.Core\\\\\\\\n### `@alternateType` {#@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.alternateType}\\\\\\\\n# libraries#typespec-client-generator-core#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ClientGenerator.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@alternateType` {#@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.alternateType}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| alternate | `unknown \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| ClientGenerator.Core.ExternalType` | The alternate type to apply to the target.

Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion,  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s the recommended way to change only the documentation (description/comments) between API versions while keeping all properties and models the same?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFrom what I understand, versioning decorators don\\\\u2019t apply to descriptions/comments, so doc changes propagate to all emitted JSON/OpenAPI versions.

It is a best practice to add versioning support to your specification from the first version. To do that, you will need to define an `enum` containing your service versions and then apply the `@versioned` decorator to your service namespace.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is an example for the `WidgetManager` service:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things to point out here:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We define an `enum` called `Versions` inside of the service namespace. For each service version, we map a version symbol like `v2022_08_31` to a version string like `2022-08-31`. This service currently only has a single version, but we can add more to this enum as things change over time.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We add the `@versioned` decorator and reference the `Versions` enum we defined using the fully-qualified name `Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions`. This marks the service as being versioned and specifies the set of versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We change the `@useDependency` decorator we used previously to now link each service version to a specific version of `Azure.Core`. See the [Using Azure.Core Versions](#using-azurecore-versions) section for more information.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nImagine that it's 3 months later and you want to release a new version of your service with some slight changes. Add a new version to the `Versions` enum:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-11-30\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will also need to add the `@useDependency` decorator:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-11-30\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, you can express changes to your service using the `@added` and `@removed` decorators. Here's an example of adding a new property to `Widget` and removing an old one:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A widget. */\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#versioning#guide.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/versioning/guide\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Tutorial\\\\\\\\n## Versioning APIs\\\\\\\\n# libraries#versioning#guide.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Tutorial\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Versioning APIs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe versioning library simplifies the process of versioning APIs. Let's start with a basic example. Assume we have a service with a single API that returns a list of widgets. We can define that API like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Rest;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Error {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  code: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  message?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 2 of the service, we add a get operation to retrieve a single widget. We can add that like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget/{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop get(...Resource.KeysOf\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 3 of the service, we realize that `name` is not accurate and that this field should be called `description`. Also, we decide that the description should be optional, not mandatory. We can implement these changes like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  widgetId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe made the change to the actual model property so that it now reflects the correct name and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, the OpenAPI definition for versions 1 and 2 still reflect the original name and the mandatory nature of the property:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    name:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is a common pattern with the versioning decorators. The TypeSpec should represent the _current state_ of the API. The decorators indicate the version at which this definition became accurate and, depending on the decorator, the other parameters reflect the previous values to retain that information.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"What decorator should be used in this case?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# What decorator should be used in this case?\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# What decorator should be used in this case?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi team, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version v2, we introduced a new model model2 and updated featureA (originally added in v1) to use model2 as its parameter. In v1, featureA used model1 at the same position. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s the setup I tried (using @typeChangedFrom):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(v1)  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel1;  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(v2)  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel2;  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(v1)  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nfeatureA {  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @typeChangedFrom(v1, model1)  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  body: model2;  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n} \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, this shows the error: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"model2 does not exist in v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhat would be the correct decorator to use in this situation? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThank you!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nit should be `typedChangedFrom(v2, model1` here otherwise you are saying in v1 you changed from using model1 to model2 which then of course doesn't exists\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_http_specs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"versioning#returntypechangedfrom#main.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Usages for Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/packages/http-specs/specs/versioning/returntypechangedfrom/main.tsp\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Usages for Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\\n## Full Sample:\\\\\\\\n# versioning#returntypechangedfrom#main.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Usages for Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Full Sample:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n// main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing TypeSpec.Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * Test for the `@returnTypeChangedFrom` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@server(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{endpoint}/versioning/return-type-changed-from/api-version:{version}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Testserver endpoint\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     * Need to be set as 'http://localhost:3000' in client.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    endpoint: url,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     * Need to be set as 'v1' or 'v2' in client.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    version: Versions,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Versioning.ReturnTypeChangedFrom;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * The version of the API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The version v1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * The version v2.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/test\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@post\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@returnTypeChangedFrom(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Versions.v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    contentType: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    @body\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    body: int32,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop test(@header contentType: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", @body body: string): {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  contentType: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @body\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  body: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

[!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e This article assumes you came here from your REST API specs PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e See [this documentation section description](xref:specs-pr-guides) for details.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOn your Azure REST API specs PR, some of the GitHub check failures (see the `Checks` tab on your PR) can be suppressed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe suppression can be either just for the PR, or permanent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## To suppress given validation failure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Determine which failing check you want to suppress: see its name in the `Checks` tab in your PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Determine if you have one of the [valid suppression reasons](#valid-suppression-reasons).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Determine if you want to suppress the failure only for the PR, or permanently. Permanent suppression is preferred to avoid re-addressing the same issue in future PRs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Consult [the suppression cases table](#suppression-cases-table) for instructions corresponding to your case.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. If you want to apply temporary suppression:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Mention in a comment on your PR the PR assignee asking to apply the suppression. Provide justification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      See [valid suppression reasons](#valid-suppression-reasons).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. If you applied permanent suppression:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. It will manifest by the PR getting a label `SuppressionReviewRequired`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Verify the suppression works by the check changing from **failed** to **neutral**.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Wait until your suppression is reviewed. If it is approved, the approved will add the `Approved-Suppression` label.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Understand the suppression won't be approved if it is not one of the  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      [valid suppression reasons](#valid-suppression-reasons) as explained in relevant

This is important in scenarios such as:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An update to a dependency or sub-dependency introduces an unexpected breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Updates to a new version of a service should not impact older versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Modifications are made to the TypeSpec specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese issues can be mitigated with a few precautionary measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Defend against dependency changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: This section applies if using `tsp install` or `npm install` to install dependencies. However other package managers (`yarn`, `pnpm`, etc.) have their own similar lock mechanisms._\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen using `tsp install` or `npm install` a `package-lock.json` will be installed. This file SHOULD be committed to source control. It will ensure that later calls to `tsp install` or `npm install` will use the exact versions resolved in the lock files unless the `package.json` was updated or a command like `npm update` was run.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe command `npm ci` can also be used in the CI to ensure that the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are in sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Work with multiple versions of a service\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a library `@typespec/versioning` that can be used to describe changes to a service or library over time. Using this will ensure that a service can evolve while keeping track of the changes and allowing emitters to see the service representation at different versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[See versioning docs](../libraries/versioning/reference/index.mdx)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3.

If the breaking changes reported in your PR are all intentional, then you just need to follow the instructions in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"next steps to merge\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" comment to work with the breaking changes board for approval: https://aka.ms/brch\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGenerally, breaking changes between preview api-versions are allowed if there are good reasons,  breaking changes relative to a stable api-version are more of a concern.  Also, if preview api-versions are old enough, they count as stable api-versions (I doubt that is the case here).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe case here is a preview with breaking changes relative to the last stable.

developers who build or use API definitions in OpenAPI v2 or v3.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn many cases, this will also describe how the typespec-autorest and openapi3 emitters translate\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec designs into OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe document is organized around the features of an OpenAPI v2 or v3 definition.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe idea is that if you

One is with the [TypeSpec `enum` statement](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/enums), e.g.:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- To retain the quotes from the enum values --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Color {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"red\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"green\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnother is to use the union operation to define the enum values inline, e.g.:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  size?: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"medium\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### default\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA model property that specifies a default value using \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will produce a `default` field in the schema for this property.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  answer?: int32 = 42;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  color?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"purple\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nproduces\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nanswer:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: integer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  format: int32\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  default: 42\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncolor:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  default: purple\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Host / BasePath / Servers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI v2, the `host` and `basePath` fields at the top-level of the API definition combine to form the base URL for the API. The paths defined in the `paths` object are appended to this base URL to form the absolute URL for an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI v3, the top-level `servers` field specifies an array of `server` objects [[v3][v3-server]] with a base URL, which may be parameterized, to which the operation path is appended.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-server]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#server-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, the `host` in OpenAPI v2 or `servers` in OpenAPI v3 can be specified with the `@server` decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\non the namespace (from `@typespec/http` library). You can use this decorator multiple times to specify multiple servers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Paths Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI, the `paths` object [[v2][v2-paths], [v3][v3-paths]] is the top-level structure for defining the operations of the API, organized by the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"path\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v2-paths]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#paths-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-paths]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#paths-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, you can specify the path for a namespace, interface, or operation using the `@route` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the value of the `@route` decorator contains path parameters, operations within the scope of the decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmust declare parameters with the same name and type. If an operation declares a path parameter that is not present\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin the route, this defines a new path that is the value from the `@route` decorator with the path parameter appended.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Pets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op create(@body pet: Pet): Pet; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op read(@path petId: int32): Pet; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets/{petId}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the `@route` decorator is used within a namespace or interface that also has a `@route` decorator, the path is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nobtained by concatenating the routes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Widgets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // widgets operations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/{id}/parts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  namespace Parts {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    op list(@path id: string): Part[] | Error; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widgets/{id}/parts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Path Item Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI, a path item object [[v2][v2-pathitem], [v3][v3-pathitem]] describes the operations available on a single path. A path may have at most one `get`, `put`, `post`, `patch`, `delete`, or `head` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v2-pathitem]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#path-item-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-pathitem]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#path-item-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, operations are defined within a namespace or interface with a syntax similar to typescript functions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe HTTP method for an operation can be specified explicitly using a decorator: `@get`, `@put`, `@post`, `@patch`, `@delete`, or `@head`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf an HTTP method decorator is not specified then the default is `post` if there is a body and `get` otherwise.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@tag(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Gadgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/gadgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Gadgets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op create(@body gadget: Gadget): Gadget | Error; // uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"post\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" method\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op read(@path id: string): Gadget | Error; // uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"get\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" method\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOther path item fields:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| OpenAPI `pathItem` field | TypeSpec construct | Notes                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `summary`                |                    |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#04-common-parameters.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Common Parameters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/04-common-parameters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Common Parameters\\\\\\\\n## Introduction\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#getting-started-rest#04-common-parameters.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Common Parameters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Introduction\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this section, we'll focus on reusing common parameters in your REST API.

local:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.Previously we had multiple Swagger Spec Files like advisor.json, assessments.json and resiliencyReviews.json each having a subset of endpoints in line with different Advisor Portal Blades, but with TypeSpec generated Swagger we only have a single openapi.json spec file containing all endpoints. Is this a mandatory requirement with TypeSpec going forward that for each RP we need to generate and maintain a single spec?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.Multiple Tag Name updates - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Metadata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" -\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"MetadataEntities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Could such changes lead to any breaking impact on Customers side. Also, from documentation perspective can we update these Tag Names to be similar as past?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3.summary for endpoints has been moved to description. Also. few parameter descriptions are updated. Is there recommended practise being followed here?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4.Response description updated to be more generic as an Azure Operation and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"systemData\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" section added as part of 200 Response. Are these done as per any recommended guidelines?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor one thing. the most important thing for the spec is that is accurately represents the API.  There is client decoration available in many cases to keep the sdk from breaking as we make sure the API is accurate:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nx-ms-skip-url-encoding:  Parameters like 'scope'  and 'resourceUri'  generally contain multiple path segments.  If they occur in a path parameter, you almost always want those path segments included in the path, so skipping url; encoding is appropriate.  If they occur in query parameters, then url encoding is irrelevant.  You can specificall set url encoding for path parameters by decorating with @path(#{allowReserved: true})\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe value array.  Generally, the Value array occurs in list types, which also have a nextLink.  No more properties should mean no more nextLink.  It is almost always the case in actual practice that value always occurs in list responses, and this was a piece of inaccurate variance in the original spec.  The best practice is to validate that your service can have a response that does not contain a value property (which is unlikely), and only change the response type then.  Whether or not this is the case, it is highly unlikely to have any impact on clients, which have standard mechaniisms for handling paged types.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSingle OpenAPI file:  Teams no longer maintain the OpenAPI spec, they maintain the TypeSpec as the source of truth and OpenApi is generated from that, so the layout of the OpenAPI files should not be important going forward, except in some limited cases (for example, some teams have special configuration for PowerShell cmdlets that only generate cmdlets for some of their OpenApi specs).  Generally though, this should not be a concern.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTag name changes:  tags can affect Terraform.  You can use the @tag decorator (typespec core) to ensure that any missing tags are added to the spec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ndoc/summary:  The way the converter does this maximizes the usefulness of summary/description for client sdks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ngoing forward, except in some limited cases (for example, some teams have special configuration for PowerShell cmdlets that only generate cmdlets for some of their OpenApi specs).

However, due to backend delays, it\\\\u2019s been open since July. During that time, the [typespec migration PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36556) was drafted against our preview API.

Resolve conflicts  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        - For most of the conflicts, accept the incoming changes.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        - If it's unclear, please accept both and then update based on your judgement with the folder structure changes above.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      3. Make sure the new change is aligned with folder structure v2  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n         There are some cases where the PR is adding a new version in the original location, but the file diffs don't show as conflict. we should move them into the correct place so that it doesn't break the folder structure v2 as instructions in **Understanding Folder Migration sections** \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      4. clean up the previous folder if exists.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important**: It's strongly recommended to understand what's really changed in the folder refactor.

Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins. What is the suggestion here? Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Missing APIs in default tag error for typespec conversion PR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPR: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/35346\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAvocado check: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/35346/checks?check_run_id=44368323389 \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there a way to suppress the missing APIs check only for this PR since it only has typspec conversion but no update to the open API spec?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe check is trying to compare the APIs with previous stable release with currently published stable release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPart of the typespec conversion is replacing the existing swagger with a generated swagger.  The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Is TypeSpec migration complete for folder: recoveryservicesbackup.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Is TypeSpec migration complete for folder: recoveryservicesbackup.\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Is TypeSpec migration complete for folder: recoveryservicesbackup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe had PR in flight: [Adding stable 2025 08 01 for completeness by risraj10 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #37381 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/37381)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, I see that TypeSpec migration was done couple of days ago for this folder. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI have cancelled the above PR and trying to raise a new PR.

Specific validation rules do not apply to your service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   (e.g. ARM specific API validation rules may not apply to data plane API validation).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. You are blocked on resolving this issue by external teams\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   (e.g. ARM feature that would need to be let up for you to become green).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4.

You can't resolve the violations at the moment due to time constraints and planning to do it in the future.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.

Is this actually correct? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOr would we consider this a benign change? And a best practice to 'fix' unnamed types by creating named types to replace them?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIntroducing named types to replace unnamed ones is not a bad idea\\\\u2014in fact, it's preferred. The linter rule @azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core/no-unnamed-types exists to encourage naming types. However, in the PR you referenced, there was a suppression added with the justification of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Backwards compatibility with existing clients.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter reviewing the context, it seems this suppression may not be necessary. The rule itself is currently disabled due to performance issues, so removing the suppression won\\\\u2019t trigger CI. Conceptually, this is a false positive: the anonymous model created via @bodyRoot is a temporary structure that the SDK won\\\\u2019t use, so it shouldn't be flagged.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nStill, the current template resolves to a borderline case where the SDK might auto-generate a name. A cleaner approach would be to use @@clientName to rename the body parameter directly, avoiding the anonymous model altogether. This is considered a better practice.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSo yes\\\\u2014replacing unnamed types with named ones is generally a good idea, and in this case, the suppression may not be needed.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCI has been failing constantly for our PR ([Azure Load Testing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Add 2025-03-01-preview Data-Plane APIs by Harshan01 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #32585 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/32585)) for Typespec Validation step.

It is similar to TypeScript in syntax, but is specifically designed for describing the shape and behavior of APIs (such as REST, gRPC, or GraphQL), not for general-purpose programming.\nTypeSpec allows you to:\nDefine the interface of your API, including operations, request/response models, and error handling.\nGenerate artifacts such as OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications, SDKs, and documentation from a single source of truth.\nEnforce API design consistency and reduce errors, especially in large organizations or when following strict guidelines (like Azure's API standards).\nReuse and extend models and patterns using TypeSpec libraries and templates.\nFor Azure, TypeSpec has dedicated extensions and libraries that help you follow Azure API guidelines and make it easier to build ARM (Azure Resource Manager) and data-plane services. Using TypeSpec leads to APIs that are easier to review, more consistent, and better supported by tooling.\nYou can get started by installing the TypeSpec CLI and using templates to quickly scaffold a project.

            "answer": "Let's address both of your issues with the TypeSpec migration and generated Swagger:\n1. Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\n```\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: string;\n// ... other properties ...\n}\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: \"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\";\nrecoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\nAction Items:\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.",

            "answer": "1. Regarding the missing 'x-ms-discriminator-value' and the presence of the 'discriminator' property in the generated Swagger: This is by design. TypeSpec uses the standard OpenAPI 'discriminator' property to indicate polymorphic models, as specified by the @discriminator decorator. The legacy 'x-ms-discriminator-value' extension is not emitted by TypeSpec; instead, the correct OpenAPI v3 approach is to use the 'discriminator' property. Azure guidelines now expect the use of the standard 'discriminator' field for new specs, and migration from 'x-ms-discriminator-value' to 'discriminator' is intentional and correct.\n\n2. Regarding the duplicate 'objectType' property: This is a modeling issue in your TypeSpec code. When you use inheritance (extends) and both the base and derived models declare the same property ('objectType'), the generated schema will include it in both places, resulting in duplication. To avoid this, only declare 'objectType' in the base model (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and do not redeclare it in the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest). The derived model will inherit the property automatically. Your TypeSpec should look like:\n\n```typespec\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\n  objectType: string;\n  // ... other properties\n}\n\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\n  recoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure 'objectType' is only present once in the generated Swagger, inherited from the base model, and the 'discriminator' property is correctly emitted according to OpenAPI v3 standards.",

Regarding the missing 'x-ms-discriminator-value' and the presence of the 'discriminator' property in the generated Swagger: This is by design. TypeSpec uses the standard OpenAPI 'discriminator' property to indicate polymorphic models, as specified by the @discriminator decorator. The legacy 'x-ms-discriminator-value' extension is not emitted by TypeSpec; instead, the correct OpenAPI v3 approach is to use the 'discriminator' property. Azure guidelines now expect the use of the standard 'discriminator' field for new specs, and migration from 'x-ms-discriminator-value' to 'discriminator' is intentional and correct.\\\\n\\\\n2. Regarding the duplicate 'objectType' property: This is a modeling issue in your TypeSpec code. When you use inheritance (extends) and both the base and derived models declare the same property ('objectType'), the generated schema will include it in both places, resulting in duplication. To avoid this, only declare 'objectType' in the base model (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and do not redeclare it in the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest). The derived model will inherit the property automatically. Your TypeSpec should look like:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\n  objectType: string;\\\\n  // ... other properties\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\n  recoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will ensure 'objectType' is only present once in the generated Swagger, inherited from the base model, and the 'discriminator' property is correctly emitted according to OpenAPI v3 standards.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Let's address both of your issues with the TypeSpec migration and generated Swagger:\\\\n1. Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\\\\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\\\\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\\\\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\\\\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\\\\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\\\\n```\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: string;\\\\n// ... other properties ...\\\\n}\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: \\\\\\\"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\\\\\\\";\\\\nrecoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\\\\nAction Items:\\\\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\\\\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.\\\"}\"}]",

Let's start with a basic example. Assume we have a service with a single API that returns a list of widgets. We can define that API like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Rest;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Error {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  code: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  message?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 2 of the service, we add a get operation to retrieve a single widget. We can add that like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list(): Widget[] | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widget/{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop get(...Resource.KeysOf\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, let's suppose that in version 3 of the service, we realize that `name` is not accurate and that this field should be called `description`. Also, we decide that the description should be optional, not mandatory. We can implement these changes like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  widgetId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe made the change to the actual model property so that it now reflects the correct name and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname and optional nature of the property. Both the `@renamedFrom` and `@madeOptional` decorators indicate the version in which the change was made, and the `@renamedFrom` decorator also identifies the previous name of the property. This allows us to generate code that is aware of the change and can handle it appropriately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI definition of `Widget` for version 3 reflects the change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    description:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, the OpenAPI definition for versions 1 and 2 still reflect the original name and the mandatory nature of the property:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWidget:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    name:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  required:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - id\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is a common pattern with the versioning decorators. The TypeSpec should represent the _current state_ of the API. The decorators indicate the version at which this definition became accurate and, depending on the decorator, the other parameters reflect the previous values to retain that information.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#typespec-for-openapi-dev.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers\\\\\\\\n## Schema Object\\\\\\\\n### allOf and polymorphism using allOf\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#typespec-for-openapi-dev.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Schema Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### allOf and polymorphism using allOf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec supports single inheritance of models with the `extends` keyword. This construct can be used to produce an `allOf` with a single element (the parent schema) in OpenAPI.

The structure ensures clear separation between different service types while maintaining consistency across all Azure service specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nspecification/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003corganization\\\\\\\\u003e/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 cspell.yaml                     # Spell-check configuration\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 resource-manager/               # ARM services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2502   \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e/                    # Resource Provider Namespace\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2502       \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice1\\\\\\\\u003e/             # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2502       \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice2\\\\\\\\u003e/             # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 data-plane/                    # Data-plane services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice1\\\\\\\\u003e/                 # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cservice2\\\\\\\\u003e/                 # Individual service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Organization structure:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEach organization folder contains up to two main directories:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **One `resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e/` folder** for ARM services (where `\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e` is the Resource Provider Namespace) containing **one or more** `\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e` folders\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **One `data-plane/` folder** for non-ARM APIs containing **one or more** `\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e` folders\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important notes:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Organizations may have only ARM services, only data-plane services, or both\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The presence of both directories is not mandatory - it depends on the services offered by the organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### ARM services: `resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e` folder\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\u003corganization\\\\\\\\u003e/resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e` folder corresponds to an ARM **Resource Provider (RP) namespace**. This namespace defines the scope of resource management operations for the organization's ARM services.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example structure:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- RPNS example: `Microsoft.Automation`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Full path: `specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Service: `aks` service within the `Microsoft.ContainerService` ARM Resource Provider namespace\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor a complete list of Resource Providers, see the [Resource Provider list].\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e **Legacy pattern to avoid**: Many Azure teams with a single ARM service historically placed it directly in `specification/\\\\\\\\u003corganization\\\\\\\\u003e/resource-manager/` instead of following the proper `specification/\\\\\\\\u003corganization\\\\\\\\u003e/resource-manager/\\\\\\\\u003cRPNS\\\\\\\\u003e/\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e` structure.

These legacy patterns are deprecated and strongly discouraged for new services.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Service folder structure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery service folder follows a consistent structure regardless of whether it's an ARM or data-plane service.

The TypeSpec team is actively working on new designs to reduce redundancy in example organization.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor detailed information about API versioning practices, see the [API versioning guidelines].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `specification/common-types`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`specification/common-types`] directory serves a special purpose in the repository structure, containing shared definitions that can be reused across all Azure service specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Purpose and usage:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Contains common models, types, and operations used across multiple Azure services\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enables consistency and reduces duplication across service specifications\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Provides standardized definitions for common Azure patterns\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important limitations:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to share definitions beyond those available in [`specification/common-types`], you must duplicate them in each service's own folder. This requirement ensures that each service maintains independent control over the versioning lifecycle of shared definitions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Best practice for managing shared definitions:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the maintenance burden of duplicate copies, service teams can implement a shared ownership pattern:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Designate an owner service** - The service that creates or updates the shared models becomes the owner.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. **Create a `sharable/` folder** - The owner service creates this folder to make definitions available for copying.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. **Use `copyFrom*Sharable` folders** - Other services create these folders to indicate copied content that should not be edited directly.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example structure:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`diff\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nspecification/compute/resource-manager/Microsoft.Compute/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 ComputeRP\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 sharable/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 *.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 readme.md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 preview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2502   \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 stable/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 RecommenderRP\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 copyFromComputeSharable\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 *.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 main.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 readme.md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u251c\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 preview/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 stable/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Naming guidelines for `specification` folder contents\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConsistent naming conventions across the repository improve readability and reduce ambiguity.

Instead of having one resource with two distinct rp-specific properties schemas, you generally should have two resources, or have a property of the rp-specific properties be polymorphic. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDiscriminated unions are not yet handled by Azure emitters, so this isn't a good choice for Azure APIs.  You can use inheritance based discrimination instead. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's a sample using inheritance-based discrimination for a property of the rp-specific resource properties. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that you can use the 'kind' envelope property to make a resource polymorphic analogously, but this is, as I indicated, an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `@discriminator` {#@discriminator}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@discriminator` {#@discriminator}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecify the property to be used to discriminate this type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@discriminator(propertyName: valueof string)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Target\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`Model`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Type | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| propertyName | [valueof `string`](#string) | The property name to use for discrimination |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Pet{ kind: string }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Cat extends Pet {kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"cat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", meow: boolean}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog extends Pet  {kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", bark: boolean}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Data types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-data-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `DiscriminatedOptions` {#DiscriminatedOptions}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `DiscriminatedOptions` {#DiscriminatedOptions}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOptions for `@discriminated` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel DiscriminatedOptions\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Type | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| envelope?

Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_http_specs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure#client-generator-core#client-location#move-to-new-sub-client#main.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Usages for Test for @clientLocation decorator - moving operations between clients\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/blob/main/packages/azure-http-specs/specs/azure/client-generator-core/client-location/move-to-new-sub-client/main.tsp\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Usages for Test for @clientLocation decorator - moving operations between clients\\\\\\\\n## Scenario: Test moving an operation to a new sub client specified by string name.\\\\\\\\n# azure#client-generator-core#client-location#move-to-new-sub-client#main.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Usages for Test for @clientLocation decorator - moving operations between clients\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Scenario: Test moving an operation to a new sub client specified by string name.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOperation `archiveProduct` from interface `ProductOperations` should be moved to a new sub client named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ArchiveOperations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" using @clientLocation(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ArchiveOperations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Scenario 1: Move an operation to a new sub client (string name)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface ProductOperations {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/products\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @get\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listProducts(): void;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/products/archive\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @post\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @global.Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.clientLocation(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ArchiveOperations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  archiveProduct(): void;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_07.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"How to create an Example for a typespec model?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# How to create an Example for a typespec model?\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_08_07.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How to create an Example for a typespec model?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI was going through my Typespec file and adding @example() decorators on top of models but then I was informed by Azure SDK Q\\\\\\\\u0026A Bot that Azure API Spec doesn't support the @example() decorator?

Regarding the missing 'x-ms-discriminator-value' and the presence of the 'discriminator' property in the generated Swagger: This is by design. TypeSpec uses the standard OpenAPI 'discriminator' property to indicate polymorphic models, as specified by the @discriminator decorator. The legacy 'x-ms-discriminator-value' extension is not emitted by TypeSpec; instead, the correct OpenAPI v3 approach is to use the 'discriminator' property. Azure guidelines now expect the use of the standard 'discriminator' field for new specs, and migration from 'x-ms-discriminator-value' to 'discriminator' is intentional and correct.\\\\n\\\\n2. Regarding the duplicate 'objectType' property: This is a modeling issue in your TypeSpec code. When you use inheritance (extends) and both the base and derived models declare the same property ('objectType'), the generated schema will include it in both places, resulting in duplication. To avoid this, only declare 'objectType' in the base model (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and do not redeclare it in the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest). The derived model will inherit the property automatically. Your TypeSpec should look like:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\n  objectType: string;\\\\n  // ... other properties\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\n  recoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will ensure 'objectType' is only present once in the generated Swagger, inherited from the base model, and the 'discriminator' property is correctly emitted according to OpenAPI v3 standards.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Let's address both of your issues with the TypeSpec migration and generated Swagger:\\\\n1. Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\\\\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\\\\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\\\\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\\\\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\\\\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\\\\n```\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\"objectType\\\\\\\")\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: string;\\\\n// ... other properties ...\\\\n}\\\\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\\\\nobjectType: \\\\\\\"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\\\\\\\";\\\\nrecoveryPointId: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\\\\nAction Items:\\\\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\\\\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.\\\"}\"}]",

The response covers point (1) thoroughly, explaining the migration from 'x-ms-discriminator-value' to 'discriminator', referencing Azure guidelines, and clarifying that this is intentional and correct.  \\n3. For point (2), the response explains the duplication issue, recommends only declaring 'objectType' in the base model, and provides a TypeSpec code example.  \\n4.

You should use the `@Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia decorator` on your operation to explicitly specify the desired final state resolution strategy. The decorator supports values such as \"original-uri\", \"operation-location\", \"location\", and \"azure-async-operation\". For example:\n```\n@Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia(\"original-uri\")\nop createResource is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<ResourceModel>;\n```\nThis will ensure the generated OpenAPI includes the correct `x-ms-long-running-operation-options` with your chosen `final-state-via setting`.

Decorators\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecorators in TypeSpec allow developers to attach metadata to types within a TypeSpec program. They can also be used to compute types based on their inputs. Decorators form the core of TypeSpec's extensibility, providing the flexibility to describe a wide variety of APIs and associated metadata such as documentation, constraints, samples, and more.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe vast majority of TypeSpec declarations may be decorated, including [namespaces](./namespaces.md), [interfaces](./interfaces.md), [operations](./operations.md) and their parameters, [scalars](./scalars.md), and [models](./models.md) and their members. In general, any declaration that creates a Type can be decorated. Notably, [aliases](./alias.md) cannot be decorated, as they do not create new Types, nor can any type expressions such as unions that use the `|` syntax or anonymous models, as they are not declarations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDecorators are defined using JavaScript functions that are exported from a standard ECMAScript module. When a JavaScript file is imported, TypeSpec will look for any exported functions prefixed with `$`, and make them available as decorators within the TypeSpec syntax. When a decorated declaration is evaluated by TypeSpec, the decorator function is invoked, passing along a reference to the current compilation, an object representing the type it is attached to, and any arguments the user provided to the decorator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Applying decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecorators are referenced using the `@` prefix and must be placed before the entity they are decorating. Arguments can be provided by using parentheses, similar to function calls in many programming languages, e.g., `@myDec1(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", { a: string })`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's an example of declaring and then using a decorator:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@tag(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sample\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @validate(false)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf no arguments are provided, the parentheses can be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@mark\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Augmenting decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDecorators can also be applied from a different location by referring to the type being decorated. For this, you can declare an augment decorator using the `@@` prefix. The first argument of an augment decorator is the type reference that should be decorated. As the augment decorator is a statement, it must end with a semicolon (`;`).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@tag(Dog, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sample\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is equivalent to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@tag(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sample\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExample: decorating a model property to indicate that it is read-only\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@visibility(Dog.name, Lifecycle.Read);\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Creating decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more information on creating decorators, see [Creating Decorators](../extending-typespec/create-decorators.md).\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Documentation\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#documentation.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDocumentation is a vital aspect of any API. TypeSpec offers several ways to document your API, including doc comments and decorators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Approaches to documenting APIs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides two primary methods for documenting your API:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@doc` decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/** */` Doc comments\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe latter is less intrusive to the specification and is often preferred.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn both cases while not required, the documentation should be written in Markdown format, TypeSpec tooling will assume so. [See Markdown](#markdown) for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## The `@doc` decorator\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `@doc` decorator can be used to attach documentation to most TypeSpec declarations. It typically accepts a string argument that serves as the documentation for the declaration.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is a sample model\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is a sample property\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `@doc` decorator can also accept a source object, which can be used to provide templated documentation for a generic type, for example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Templated {name}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Type)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Template\\\\\\\\u003cType extends {}\\\\\\\\u003e  {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// The documentation will read \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Templated A\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel A is Template\\\\\\\\u003cA\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Doc comments\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can annotate objects in your TypeSpec specification with doc comments. These comments are treated as if they were attached using the `@doc` decorator and can be used to generate external documentation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDoc comments start with `/**` and continue until the closing `*/` is encountered. [Tags](#doc-comment-tags) can be used to provide additional documentation context.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * Get a widget.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * @param widgetId The ID of the widget to retrieve.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop read(@path widgetId: string): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is functionally equivalent to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Get a widget.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop read(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The ID of the widget to retrieve.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  widgetId: string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n): Widget | Error;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe advantage of using doc comment syntax is that it consolidates all the documentation for a declaration in one place, with distinct comment colors, making it easier to read and maintain. Additionally, it facilitates the generation of documentation using tools like TypeDoc, eliminating the need to write a custom emitter to process the @doc metadata.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Doc comment tags\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs shown in the previous example, doc comments can use certain tags to document additional elements or provide different documentation context.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Tag                     | Description                       | Example                                             |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `@param`                | Documents a parameter.            | `@param widgetId The ID of the widget to retrieve.` |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `@returns`              | Documents the operation response. | `@returns The widget.`                              |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `@template`             | Document a template parameter     | `@template T the resource type`                     |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `@example` (unofficial) | Show examples                     | `@example \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`model Foo {}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` `                        |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Comments\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec supports both single-line and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. Multi-line comments start with `/*` and continue until the closing `*/` is encountered.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// This is a single-line comment\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /* This is a multi-line comment\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  that spans multiple lines */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nComments are ignored by the compiler and do not appear in the generated output. They are intended for internal documentation of your spec and are not suitable for generating external documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Markdown\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec Documentation support CommonMark markdown formatting. The tooling(IDE extensions, doc generation, etc.) will process the documentation as markdown.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEmitters can choose to render the description as it is, convert it to their preferred format or just strip any markdown information.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is a **bold** text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is a _italic_ text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * This contains a bullet list\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * - one\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * - two\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * and code blocks\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   *\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typescript\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * dog.age = 5;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\``\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#azure-core#long-running-operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/azure-core/long-running-operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\\n## Describing Custom LRO Patterns using Azure.Core\\\\\\\\n### Custom LROs - Operation Links\\\\\\\\n# howtos#azure-core#long-running-operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Describing Custom LRO Patterns using Azure.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Custom LROs - Operation Links\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOperation links are used when the input parameters to a linked operation can be determined from parameters in the initial operation request and response. For example, if a polling operation uses the identity parameters of the initial request, and an `operationId` parameter which is returned in a header or field in the response, the link between the operations should be modeled as an Operation Link. In order to use an Operation link, each parameter of the linked operation must correspond with a parameter of the initial operation, a property of the initial request (header or body), or property of the initial response (header or body). Operation links encode a reference to the linked operation, and a mapping between the initial request and response and the parameters of the linked operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop getWidgetOperationStatus is getResourceOperationStatus\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@pollingOperation(getWidgetOperationStatus, parameterMap)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop createWidgetAsync is longRunningCreateOrReplace\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that, in the example above, the `@pollingOperation`decorator is used to specify an operation link to a StatusMonitor endpoint. This is just syntactic sugar for `@operationLink(getWidgetOperationStatus, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"polling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", parameterMap)`. To represent the logical stages of an LRO, `@pollingOperation` represents a link to a statusMonitor, and is the only decoration required for operations that comply with the recommended LRO pattern. Another decorator `@finalOperation` represents a link to an operation where the final result must be obtained my making a final request after polling has terminated.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Decorators for Operation Links in Azure.Core\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure.Core defines the following decorators for operation links\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@pollingOperation` - links a long-running operation to its status monitor endpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\na link to a statusMonitor, and is the only decoration required for operations that comply with the recommended LRO pattern.

They may also provide a mapping between the parameters and response properties of the initial request to the parameters of the linked operation. This mapping can be provided as a `Model` type parameter passed to the decorator, or by decorating the parameters and response properties of the original operation using `@lroParameter`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#azure-core#long-running-operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/azure-core/long-running-operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\\n## Long-running Operation Helpers for Emitters and Libraries\\\\\\\\n# howtos#azure-core#long-running-operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Long-running Operation Helpers for Emitters and Libraries\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Azure.Core library provides a helper that emitters can use to determine if an operation being processed is an LRO, and to provide details about how the LRO should be processed by clients, or about how operations are linked.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ngetLroMetadata( program: Program, operation: Operation) : LroMetadata | undefined;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `LroMetadata` returned from this function contains information about the linked operations and their behavior, as well as additional that clients used to processing OpenAPI2 will be able to use to process TypeSpec operations similarly:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `logicalResponse` | contains the type of the operation response, for the long-running operation (i.e. the result after polling completes).                                                                                                                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `final-state-via` | contains values corresponding to the same field in the `x-ms-long-running-operation-options` extension in OpenAPI specifications.                                                                                                                                                       |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `statusMonitor`   | contains information about the status monitor, including the status monitor type\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| contains values corresponding to the same field in the `x-ms-long-running-operation-options` extension in OpenAPI specifications.                                                                                                                                                       |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `statusMonitor`   | contains information about the status monitor, including the status monitor type                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `polling`         | contains information about polling the status monitor, including the status field and terminal status values                                                                                                                                                                            |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `final`           | contains information about how to get the result when polling completes.

This approach makes it easier to maintain consistency, apply updates, and ensure that all versions are properly documented and aligned with the overall API strategy.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#azure-core#long-running-operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/azure-core/long-running-operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\\n## Describing Custom LRO Patterns using Azure.Core\\\\\\\\n# howtos#azure-core#long-running-operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Deep Dive: Long-running (Asynchronous) Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Describing Custom LRO Patterns using Azure.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core` library also contains general structures for defining custom long-running operations using specialized model templates and decorators. The following sections describe . The primary mechanisms for linking operations are `Operation Links` and `Resource Links`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Custom LROs - Operation Links\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOperation links are used when the input parameters to a linked operation can be determined from parameters in the initial operation request and response. For example, if a polling operation uses the identity parameters of the initial request, and an `operationId` parameter which is returned in a header or field in the response, the link between the operations should be modeled as an Operation Link. In order to use an Operation link, each parameter of the linked operation must correspond with a parameter of the initial operation, a property of the initial request (header or body), or property of the initial response (header or body). Operation links encode a reference to the linked operation, and a mapping between the initial request and response and the parameters of the linked operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop getWidgetOperationStatus is getResourceOperationStatus\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@pollingOperation(getWidgetOperationStatus, parameterMap)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop createWidgetAsync is longRunningCreateOrReplace\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that, in the example above, the `@pollingOperation`decorator is used to specify an operation link to a StatusMonitor endpoint. This is just syntactic sugar for `@operationLink(getWidgetOperationStatus, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"polling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", parameterMap)`. To represent the logical stages of an LRO, `@pollingOperation` represents a link to a statusMonitor, and is the only decoration required for operations that comply with the recommended LRO pattern. Another decorator `@finalOperation` represents a link to an operation where the final result must be obtained my making a final request after polling has terminated.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Decorators for Operation Links in Azure.Core\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure.Core defines the following decorators for operation links\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@pollingOperation` - links a long-running operation to its status monitor endpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\na link to a statusMonitor, and is the only decoration required for operations that comply with the recommended LRO pattern. Another decorator `@finalOperation` represents a link to an operation where the final result must be obtained my making a final request after polling has terminated.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Decorators for Operation Links in Azure.Core\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure.Core defines the following decorators for operation links\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@pollingOperation` - links a long-running operation to its status monitor endpoint.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@finalOperation` - links a long-running operation to an additional endpoint, in the case that an additional endpoint must be called to obtain the final result after polling the status monitor is complete.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEach of these decorators require a reference to the linked operation. They may also provide a mapping between the parameters and response properties of the initial request to the parameters of the linked operation. This mapping can be provided as a `Model` type parameter passed to the decorator, or by decorating the parameters and response properties of the original operation using `@lroParameter`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Custom LROs - Resource Links\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResource links are used when the entire url of the linked operation is provided as part of the response to the initial operation. A resource link encodes the type of the expected response when the link is followed:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel WidgetStatusMonitorResponse {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @pollingLocation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @header(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Operation-Location\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  operationLocation: ResourceLocation\\\\\\\\u003cResourceOperationStatus\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // following the url in this header will provide a response of type ResourceOperationStatus\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Decorators for Resource Links in Azure.Core\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure.Core defines the following decorators for resource links used in long-running operations:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@pollingLocation` - indicates that the decorated property contains a url to the StatusMonitor. The type of the decorated property **should** be a `ResourceLocation`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`@finalLocation` - indicates that the decorated property contains a url to the final result, in cases where an additional request must be made after polling to obtain the final result of the operation. The type of the decorated property must be a `ResourceLocation`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nalias ResultHeaders = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @pollingLocation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @header(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Operation-Location\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  operationLocation: ResourceLocation\\\\\\\\u003cResourceOperationStatus\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @finalLocation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @header(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  location: ResourceLocation\\\\\\\\u003cWidget\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that the LRO templates provided in Azure.Core automatically provide the appropriate headers and resource location decoration for LROs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that operations often provide multiple mechanisms that clients may use to determine how to logically complete an operation. This is often done to allow clients with different capabilities to determine how to resolve a long-running operation. It is recommended that clients prefer using Operation links in preference to Resource links whenever possible, because OperationLinks provide more information about the next operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Status Monitor Types in Azure.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Azure services, there is clear API guidance that requires usage of the Status Monitor pattern. In Azure, the Status Monitor has a specific structure, including:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- A 'status' property containing the current status of the operation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - The status property is a string property that contains known values for terminal states, by default these are 'Succeeded' for successful operation termination, 'Failed' for operation termination with failure, and 'Canceled' to indicate the operation was canceled.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- A 'result' property, containing the result of the operation once the operation has succeeded (and is null if it has not succeeded)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- An 'error' property, containing any errors that occurred during the operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn Azure.Core, this structure is represented using the `ResourceOperationStatus\\\\\\\\u003cTResource, TSuccess, TError\\\\\\\\u003e` model. The initial response to a long-running operation in Azure must contain an `Operation-Location` header that contains a url to the StatusMonitor endpoint. The StatusMonitor endpoint Url can also be calculated using the key properties of the resource and an additional `operationId` key property. To allow repeatability of requests and automatic calculation of the statusMonitor Uri, each LRO should allow an `OperationId` header that sets the operationId for the operation id execution. The `OperationId` must also be included in a header in the initial lro response. These patterns are encoded in the `LongRunning` operation templates provided in Azure.Core. If your service description uses these templates, it will automatically be following the recommended pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Decorators and Types for Custom StatusMonitors in Azure.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA StatusMonitor provides information that drives client polling until an operation completes. This includes a `status` field containing the current state of the operation, with known values for terminal states, headers that suggest polling retry intervals, and fields that will contain result and error information when the operation reaches a terminal status. Azure.Core provides a `ResourceOperationStatus` template that defines the standard Azure status monitor for an Azure operation. However, some services may need to implement custom status monitors. Azure.Core provides additional decorators to help clients use custom status monitors.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Decorator                    | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `@lroStatus`                 | A decorator marking the field of the StatusMonitor that contains status information.

To achieve this, you can use a combination of `@removed`, `@added`, and `@renamedFrom` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"experience\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldExperience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read, Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  experience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Adding a Parameter to an Operation and Making Another Parameter Optional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario shows how to add a parameter and make another optional in an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following operation in v1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Make the `location` header parameter optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add a new optional query parameter `orderBy`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can achieve this using the `@madeOptional` and `@added` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @query(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order-by\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      orderBy?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@madeOptional(Versions.v2)` makes `location` optional starting in v2.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the `orderBy` query parameter in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario illustrates converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one across versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following synchronous operation in `v1`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you update this operation to be asynchronous as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdateV1 is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@removed(Versions.v2)` removes the original synchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` keeps the original name for v1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the new asynchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@sharedRoute` ensures both operations can use the same route.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Release

typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Release new api version process with TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi folks, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDo you have any process or script to execute when creating a new api version with TypeSpec which is similar to current [Copy-ApiVersion.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/eng/scripts/Copy-ApiVersion.ps1) script with API Spec?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs within the TypeSpec, those examples needs to be added manually and change the api version in it. I wonder if there are any existing script for doing this. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSPec, this is much simpler.  You don't need to replicate your old APIs, you just encode the changes in the api and tag them with decorators from the versioning library, as discussed here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning/) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will need to copy the example files from the example directory from the last version into a new example directory for the new version, and add any new examples. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask questions here, or come to our office hours on Monday.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Does TypeSpec have the option to achieve mutually exclusive?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Does TypeSpec have the option to achieve mutually exclusive?\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Does TypeSpec have the option to achieve mutually exclusive?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have 2 properties `awsCloudProfile`and `gcpCloudProfilein` our preperties in our typespec update. These 2 properties are mutually exclusive(ensuring that only one of `awsCloudProfile` or `gcpCloudProfile` can exist at a time). Besides setting both of them to optional, is there any other options in TypeSpec that we can achieve the mutually exclusive without causing a breaking change?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere isn't currently a built-in way in TypeSpec to enforce mutual exclusivity between properties like `awsCloudProfile` and `gcpCloudProfile`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn your PR, you're making both properties optional \\\\u2014 but that\\\\u2019s actually a breaking change. Clients may have previously assumed that `awsCloudProfile` was always present, and now that constraint is being relaxed, which breaks existing behavior.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAzure's recommended pattern for such cases is to use **explicit discriminated unions** to simplify the client experience. That means defining a `CloudProfile` union with a `@discriminator(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` to clearly indicate which cloud provider the profile belongs to. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```typescript\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@discriminator(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nunion CloudProfile {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  aws: AwsCloudProfile;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  gcp: GcpCloudProfile;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel AwsCloudProfile {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aws\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  awsAccountId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel GcpCloudProfile {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  kind: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"gcp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  projectProperties?: GcpProjectProperties;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  organizationProperties?: GcpOrganizationProperties;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  isOrganization?: boolean = false;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWith this structure, your `CloudConnectorProperties` model just needs a single `cloudProfile` property. It allows you to support AWS, GCP, or any other provider in future API versions without breaking changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo clarify a few key points:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Is the `kind` property set by the customer?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   Yes, it appears on the wire. In some SDKs, the customer needs to set it explicitly; in others, it may be inferred by the SDK type system.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. **Does `kind` already exist in your types?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   No, it doesn\\\\u2019t. This change would be a breaking change \\\\u2014 but one that allows forward compatibility when adding more cloud providers.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. **Would the `hostType` property still be needed?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   No, it would become redundant if you adopt this `@discriminator` union pattern.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs a side note: TypeSpec has introduced a `@discriminated` decorator for unions, which supports more flexible patterns, but it is not yet supported by all SDK emitters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Does `kind` already exist in your types?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   No, it doesn\\\\u2019t.

It\\\\u2019s under investigation and targeted for support around August. However, the `@discriminator` pattern (which you are using here) is already required to be supported by all SDK emitters and is safe to use today.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_migration_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec-migration-docs-2025-07-31.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"202

For this pattern, the client initiates the operation on the service, and then the client repeatedly polls the service (via another API call) to track the operation's progress/completion.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLROs are always started by 1 logical client and may be polled (have their status checked) by the same client, another client, or even multiple clients/browsers. An example would be a dashboard or portal that shows all the operations along with their status.  See the [Long Running Operations section](./ConsiderationsForServiceDesign.md#long-running-operations) in Considerations for Service Design for an introduction to the design of long-running operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#lro-response-time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lro-response-time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003e:white_check_mark:\\\\\\\\u003c/a\\\\\\\\u003e **DO** implement an operation as an LRO if the 99th percentile response time is greater than 1 second and when the client should poll the operation before making more progress.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003ca href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#lro-no-patch-lro\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lro-no-patch-lro\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003e:no_entry:\\\\\\\\u003c/a\\\\\\\\u003e **DO NOT** implement PATCH as an LRO.

The response lists all supported values (\\\"original-uri\\\", \\\"operation-location\\\", \\\"location\\\", \\\"azure-async-operation\\\"), as in the ground truth.  \\n4. It provides a usage example, though the value used is \\\"azure-async-operation\\\" instead of \\\"original-uri\\\" and the operation signature is generic, not the specific ARM example in the ground truth.  \\n5. The response explains that the decorator ensures the generated OpenAPI includes the correct `x-ms-long-running-operation-options` with the specified value, matching the ground truth.  \\n6. It mentions compliance with Azure API guidelines and recommends this approach, similar to the ground truth's alignment with Azure REST API and ARM guidelines.  \\n7. The response adds a note about ARM resource templates having built-in defaults, which is extra but not contradictory.  \\n8. The only minor omission is the specific ARM operation example (`createResource is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<ResourceModel>`), but the generic example still demonstrates correct usage.  \\n9. All key claims and statements from the ground truth are present and accurate, with only a minor difference in the example's specificity.</S0>\\n<S1>The response contains all necessary and relevant information from the ground truth, with only a minor difference in the example's specificity. It is otherwise fully complete.</S1>\\n<S2>5</S2>\"}]",

            "answer": "There is a mandatory timeframe for brownfield Resource Providers (RPs) to migrate from OpenAPI Swagger to TypeSpec: all brownfield services must transition to TypeSpec Azure by March 30, 2026. Starting in Q4FY26, PRs for new API versions that are not based on TypeSpec will be blocked, and SDK releases from non-TypeSpec specs will also be blocked. This requirement ensures consistency and quality across Azure APIs.\n\nIt is NOT allowed to mix TypeSpec with handwritten Swagger during migration. Services must wholly switch to TypeSpec; partial migration (such as migrating one resource type at a time and mixing TypeSpec with Swagger) is not permitted. The migration must result in a single, unified API version for the service. If your service currently uses different API versions for different resources, you will need to plan for conformance, which may involve splitting SDKs or achieving version uniformity.\n\nThe recommended approach is to plan and execute a full migration to TypeSpec, using the provided conversion tools and following the documented migration process. You can find detailed guidance and tooling at the official TypeSpec Azure migration documentation.",

In rare scenarios, this behavior is acceptable. | Runtime | | \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| RPC-Put-V1-18 | 5xx errors should only be used in temporary error scenarios where a retry of the operation has a chance of succeeding | Required | 5xx errors usually result in a retry from the client assuming it is a temporary situation. If a service runtime throws 5xx for permanent error conditions, it gives a wrong impression and leads to unnecessary retries from the client that are guaranteed to never pass. | Runtime |  | \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| RPC-Put-V1-19 | Tracked resources **must** not be used beyond the third level of nesting. Doing so causes undefined behaviors for the tracked resources beyond the third level. | Required | ARM supports and guarantees consistent behaviors like consistent routing semantics, consistent RBAC application only for tracked resources until the third level.

Since you are not checking this spec in to the main branch of the private repo, these can be safely ignored.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Extend ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Extend ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Extend ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy customer has this resource definition:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Discount\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"object\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-azure-resource\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": true,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Resource definition for Discounts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"allOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$ref\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../../../../../common-types/resource-management/v6/types.json#/definitions/ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      ],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Discount properties\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-client-flatten\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": true,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$ref\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#/definitions/DiscountProperties\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI tried this TypeSpec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@Azure.ResourceManager.Private.armResourceInternal(DiscountProperties)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@TypeSpec.Http.Private.includeInapplicableMetadataInPayload(false)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Discount extends Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Resource = Discount,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    KeyName = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"discountName\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    SegmentName = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"discounts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    NamePattern = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"^[a-zA-Z0-9_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.]+$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The resource-specific properties for this resource.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @Azure.ResourceManager.Private.conditionalClientFlatten\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties: DiscountProperties;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nError message is: @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager/arm-resource-invalid-base-type: The @armResourceInternal decorator can only be used on a type that ultimately extends TrackedResource, ProxyResource, or ExtensionResource. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI don't quite understand this error, since ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet does extend TrackedResource.

Instead, we should spread in the appropriate properties using a tracked resource. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe ResourceModelWithAllowedPropertySet is meant as an example, not as something resources should use, and so far usage in the specs repo has been incredibly light.

This section explains how resource models are identified and appropriate base models from the TypeSpec resource manager library are selected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn ARM Resource model should extend one of the typespec common-types Resource models when it meets **all** of the following criteria:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. There is a GET operation for the model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. At least one operation returns a 200 response containing this model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. The model has properties named `id`, `name`, and `type`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOnce a model is identified as a resource, it is represented by extending an appropriate [resource model](../../howtos/ARM/resource-type.md#modeling-resources-in-typespec) from the TypeSpec library.

The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM-Decorators-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec ARM Decorator Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec ARM Decorator Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 20. @subscriptionResource\\\\\\\\n### TypeSpec Example\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec-ARM-Decorators-Documentation.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec ARM Decorator Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 20. @subscriptionResource\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Description\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`@subscriptionResource` marks an Azure Resource Manager resource model as a subscription resource.

The sdk failures for flattenProperty are due to those SDKs not being up-to-date with the latest version of typespec-client-generator-core, which was released earlier this week.

For migration scenarios, using `@flattenProperty` is acceptable to preserve existing SDK behavior.\\\\n- The decorator can be scoped to specific languages if needed, but by default applies to all.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** Do not use OpenAPI-specific decorators like `@extension(\\\\\\\"x-ms-client-flatten\\\\\\\", ...)` in TypeSpec, as these are not supported for Azure services and will break multi-emitter compatibility.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:** Use `@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.Legacy.flattenProperty` on the `properties` field to preserve `x-ms-client-flatten: true` in the generated OpenAPI and SDKs.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Add\\\\n@@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.Legacy.flattenProperty(ArcSettings.propeties)\\\\nBy convention put this in a back-compatible.tsp file.\\\"}\"}]",

            "answer": "For a property in a TypeSpec ARM resource provider model that represents a dictionary (object) mapping strings to strings, you should use the built-in `Record<string>` type.\nFor example:\n```\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\nmetadata?: Record<string>;\n}\n```\nThis models a property (`metadata`) that is an object/dictionary where all keys and values are strings, equivalent to `{ [key: string]: string }` in TypeScript or `Dictionary<string, string>` in .NET.\nYou should not use `{}` (empty model) or just `Record` (without specifying the value type) as these are either incomplete or invalid in TypeSpec. The correct, type-safe way is `Record<string>`, which will be emitted to OpenAPI/Swagger as an `object` with `additionalProperties: { type: \"string\" }`.\nIf your API spec review asks for a 'model', you can define a named type:\n```\nmodel MetadataModel is Record<string>;\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\nmetadata?: MetadataModel;\n}\n```\nBut `Record<string>` is the canonical, recommended approach for a string-to-string dictionary in TypeSpec ARM resource definitions.\nNote: While this is technically correct, ARM guidelines recommend against unbounded dictionary/object types unless absolutely necessary, as they can limit Azure Policy and ARG capabilities. Use with care, and document any supported/expected keys in your @doc comments if possible.",

Do not use `{}` or an empty model, as TypeSpec requires a model type and `{}` is not valid. Also, do not use just `Record` without a type parameter, as it requires the value type to be specified.\n\nIf you want the property to be required, omit the `?`:\n\n```typespec\nmetadata: Record<string>;\n```\n\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure management-plane API guidelines.",

Refer to [property ordering](#property-ordering) for more details.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Optional properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nProperties can be designated as optional by using the `?` symbol.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  address?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Default values\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nProperties can be assigned a default value using the `=` operator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  address?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wild\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8 = 0;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Property ordering\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nProperties are arranged in the order they are defined in the source. Properties acquired via `model is` are placed before properties defined in the model body. Properties obtained via `...` are inserted at the point where the spread appears in the source.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Pet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel HasHome {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  address: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Cat is Pet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  meow: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...HasHome;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  furColor: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// The resulting property order for Cat is:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// name, age, meow, address, furColor\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Additional properties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `Record\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e` model can be used to define a model with an arbitrary number of properties of type T. It can be combined with a named model to provide some known properties.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are three ways to achieve this, each with slightly different semantics:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Using the `...` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Using the `is` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Using the `extends` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Using the `...` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSpreading a Record into your model implies that your model includes all the properties you have explicitly defined, plus any additional properties defined by the Record. This means that a property in the model could be of a different and incompatible type with the Record value type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// In this example, the Person model has a property `age` that is an int32, but also has other properties that are all strings.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Using the `is` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen using `is Record\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`, it indicates that all properties of this model are of type T. This means that each property explicitly defined in the model must also be of type T.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe example below would be invalid\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person is Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  //   ^ int32 is not assignable to string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut the following would be valid\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person is Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Using the `extends` operator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `extends` operator has similar semantics to `is`, but it defines the relationship between the two models. In many languages, this would probably result in the same emitted code as `is` and it is recommended to use `is Record\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e` instead.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person extends Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Special property types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### `never`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA model property can be declared as having the type `never`. This can be interpreted as the model not having that property.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis can be useful in a model template to omit a property.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Address\\\\\\\\u003cTState\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  state: TState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  street: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel UKAddress is Address\\\\\\\\u003cnever\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::note\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe responsibility of removing `never` properties lies with the emitter. The TypeSpec compiler will not automatically omit them.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Array\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrays are models created using the `[]` syntax, which is a shorthand for using the `Array\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e` model type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Model composition\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Spread\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe spread operator (`...`) copies the members of a source model into a target model. This operation doesn't create any nominal relationship between the source and target, making it useful when you want to reuse common properties without generating complex inheritance relationships.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Animal {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  species: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Pet {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Animal;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Pet;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// The Dog model is equivalent to the following declaration:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  species: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Extends\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are times when you want to create an explicit relationship between two models, such as when you're generating class definitions in languages that support inheritance.

timestamp of resource last modification (UTC) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nARM will provide the values in the `x-ms-arm-resource-system-data` header to the provider on resource write and resource action calls in JSON format (as shown above). For ProxyOnly resources, the resource provider is the source of truth. ARM will provide best effort values in the header, but the provider should update the values, including missing values, from known metadata. The `systemData` object should be defined in the resource swagger and persisted in provider storage to serve on all responses for the resource (GET, PUT, PATCH).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**You should only update the systemData properties of a resource if there is a change that affects a user-modifiable property in the control plane JSON configuration of that resource.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### POST operations ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor POST operations on tracked resources, ARM will send all the header values. For POST (create) operations on proxy resources, ARM will send all the header values. For POST (action) operations on proxy resources, ARM sends the lastModified* values only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Resource move ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResource move is treated as a combination of creation and deletion. The RP should be consistent with this logic and replace all values accordingly.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nARM passes one single x-ms-arm-resource-system-data header for the complete move operation. For example, if you have 20 resources to be moved in one request, the expectation from RPs is to save the same system data for each of these 20 resources. In this example,  moving 20 resources is equal to creating 20 resources, and therefore, the systemData values are the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### FAQ ###\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nif there is a change that affects a user-modifiable property in the control plane JSON configuration of that resource. Children resources should have their own systemData values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What is the format of the timestamps being sent? What if the value is null (i.e. can\\\\u2019t supply the createdAt)? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRPs should either return null or emit the property. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Should internal adminstration operations like updating VM images results in an update of the related resources' systemData properties?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOperations should only change the systemData properties if the change affects user-modifiable properties within the resource's JSON configuration. If a user-modifiable property changes, it should update the systemData values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Can I use a new *ByType value? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRPs should only use *ByType values supported by the related enum in the [common types definition](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/common-types/resource-management/v1/types.json). The currently supported *ByType values are User, Application, ManagedIdentity, and Key.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Can I add systemData to my current API version? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNo. Adding systemData is a breaking change and should only be included as part of a new API version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Is there any situation where the RP will have to interpret the values we are passed and do something? Or do we just store the data and return it? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor tracked resources, the values can simply be stored. Since ARM is not aware of all changes to proxy or dataplane-modifiable resources, the values may have to be interpreted for these resource types.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### How should we store the *ByType values so that we do not have to update the API when more values are added to the identity types? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou should store the *ByType values as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Is it OK to collect this data in Microsoft telemetry streams (e.g., Geneva, Kusto, COSMOS, etc.)? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**No.** This data is considered Customer Data [Customer Content and End User Identifiable Information (EUII)] and must **NOT** be collected in any telemetry streams in order to meet our data handling requirements. It should only be included in the activity log for and accessible by each individual customer.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What values should I use for long-running operations? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe systemData properties should reflect the values from when the operation was triggered.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Should I replace the values if the operation fails or is cancelled? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDo not update system data on a request that was rejected synchronously, but keep the values the triggered-time values if an async operation fails or is cancelled. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What is expected for resources that already exist prior to an RP's implementation of systemData? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nARM doesn\\\\u2019t maintain the systemData details and will not fill them up before returning to the client. As a result, as the RP, you are expected to save the values from the first PUT. If the resource already existed prior to your systemData implementation, you can supply null or omit the value when it is not returned by ARM.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Should a parent resource's systemData values be impacted by the creation or modification of children resources? ####\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNo. You should only update the systemData properties of a resource if there is a change that affects a user-modifiable property in the control plane JSON configuration of that resource. Children resources should have their own systemData values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What is the format of the timestamps being sent?

Swagger, but \\\\u2026 TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice. The VS code integration right out of the box is something I've really liked.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### MS Learn\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EXjQ3t7i-z9BpxVUgZVcS6QBxjLYdRLUquX2y8xczNxfbA?e=nesl3Q)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\u201cOne of the highlights [of using TypeSpec] was our ability to author API specs in a very simple and intuitive language. This meant that even [our PMs] who are not engineers were able to understand these API specifications. They could review them, make comments, and participate in designing those APIs.\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Azure AI Content Safety\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EdlE2PYtZ9BKoXQ-R0h-O10B9RidePBT4mwB1JgIqRC01A?e=JRneI2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I find TypeSpec to be much simpler to learn and write compared to Swagger. In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#identifiers.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Identifiers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/identifiers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Identifiers\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#identifiers.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Identifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifiers are names used to reference models, enums, operations, properties, and other entities in TypeSpec. Understanding identifier rules is essential for writing valid TypeSpec code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Identifier syntax rules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn identifier must follow these rules:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Start with**: A letter (a-z, A-Z), emoji, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Followed by**: Any combination of letters, numbers (0-9), emoji, underscores, or dollar signs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Length**: One or more characters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec implements [UAX31-R1b stable identifiers](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#R1b) with the [emoji profile](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Emoji_Profile), providing full Unicode support for international characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `cat`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `Dog`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `_Item2`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `$money$`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `\\\\ud83c\\\\udf89`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u2705 `\\\\ud83d\\\\ude80`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u274c `1cat`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- \\\\u274c `*dog`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Escaping identifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to use reserved keywords or invalid identifiers, TypeSpec provides an escaping mechanism using backticks (`` ` ``). This allows you to use:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Reserved keywords as identifiers\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Identifiers that don't follow normal syntax rules\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Identifiers with special characters or unusual formats\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `enum` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `interface` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop `import`(): void;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `123InvalidName` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `my-special-model` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel `User Profile` {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#discriminated-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Discriminated Types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/discriminated-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Discriminated Types\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#discriminated-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Discriminated Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec allows for the expression of unions and inheritance.

In particular, the types `numeric`, `integer`, `decimal`, `float`, `int64`, `uint64`, and `decimal128` are marshalled as a `Numeric` type. All other numeric types are marshalled as `number`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen marshalling custom scalar subtypes, the marshalling behavior of the known supertype is used. For example, a `scalar customScalar extends numeric` will marshal as a `Numeric`, regardless of any value constraints that might be present.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Legacy value marshalling\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWith legacy value marshalling, TypeSpec strings, numbers, and booleans values are always marshalled as JS values. All other values are marshalled as their corresponding type. For example, `null` is marshalled as `NullType`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| TypeSpec Value Type | Marshalled value in JS |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------- | ---------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `string`            | `string`               |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `numeric`           | `number`               |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `boolean`           | `boolean`              |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNote that with legacy marshalling, because JavaScript numbers have limited range and precision, it is possible to define values in TypeSpec that cannot be accurately represented in JavaScript.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### String templates and marshalling\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a decorator parameter type is `valueof string`, a string template passed to it will also be marshalled as a string.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec type system will already validate the string template can be serialized as a string.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextern dec doc(target: unknown, name: valueof string);\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nalias world = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"world!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello ${world} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") // receive: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello world!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello ${123} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") // receive: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello 123\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello ${true} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") // receive: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello true\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Bar {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello ${Bar} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") // not called error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     ^ String template cannot be serialized as a string.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Typescript type Reference\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| TypeSpec Parameter Type      | TypeScript types                             |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen decorators are passed types, the type is passed as-is. When a decorator is passed a TypeSpec value, the decorator receives a JavaScript value with a type that is appropriate for representing that value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::note\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis behavior depends on the value of the `valueMarshalling` [package flag](../extending-typespec/basics.md#f-set-package-flags). This section describes the behavior when `valueMarshalling` is set to `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"new\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. In a future release this will become the default value marshalling so it is strongly recommended to set this flag. But for now, the default value marshalling is `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"legacy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` which is described in the next section. In a future release the `valueMarshalling` flag will need to be set to `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"legacy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` to keep the previous marshalling behavior, but the flag will eventually be removed entirely.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| TypeSpec value type | Marshalled type in JS             |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `string`            | `string`                          |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `boolean`           | `boolean`                         |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `numeric`           | `Numeric` or `number` (see below) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `null`              | `null`                            |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| enum member         | `EnumMemberValue`                 |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen marshalling numeric values, either the `Numeric` wrapper type is used, or a `number` is passed directly, depending on whether the value can be represented as a JavaScript number without precision loss. In particular, the types `numeric`, `integer`, `decimal`, `float`, `int64`, `uint64`, and `decimal128` are marshalled as a `Numeric` type.

For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Legs {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** number of legs */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  legs: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Legs;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Cat {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Legs;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Snake {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // snakes have no legs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### additionalProperties/unevaluatedProperties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can generate a schema with `additionalProperties` with the TypeSpec `Record` construct.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Note:** `unevaluatedProperties` is used instead of `additionalProperties` when emitting Open API 3.1 specs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar: Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nis produced as\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo get a schema having both `properties` and `additionalProperties`, define a model that extends `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Bar extends Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nproduces\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    bar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo define a schema with `additionalProperties` that has a specific type, use the `Record` construct with a type parameter.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar: Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nresults in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo define a schema that **does not** allow any additional properties, use `Record\\\\\\\\u003cnever\\\\\\\\u003e`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar: Record\\\\\\\\u003cnever\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nresults in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    not: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the openapi3 emitter, schemas that don't define `additionalProperties` can automatically be set to `additionalProperties: { not: {} }` by setting the `seal-object-schemas` emitter option to `true`. This will not add `additionalProperties` to object schemas that are referenced in an `allOf` of another schema.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### allOf and polymorphism using allOf\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec supports single inheritance of models with the `extends` keyword.

This will ensure you have the required `value` and `nextLink` properties, and that `nextLink` is correctly annotated.\nAfter adding `@list`, the generated Swagger/OpenAPI will include:\n```\n\"x-ms-pageable\": {\n\"nextLinkName\": \"nextLink\"\n}\n```\nIf you have a custom response model, make sure it uses the `@pageItems` and `@nextLink` decorators:\n```\nmodel ElasticSnapshotPolicyVolumeList {\n@pageItems\nvalue: ElasticSnapshotPolicyVolume[];\n@nextLink\nnextLink?: string;\n}\n```\nSummary:\nAdd `@list` to your operation.\nUse the ARM paging model or annotate your custom model with `@pageItems` and `@nextLink`.\nNo need to manually add the `x-ms-pageable` extension via `@extension`\u2014the emitter handles this for you when `@list` is present.\nThis approach is fully compliant with Azure API guidelines and will resolve your `XmsPageableForListCalls` lintDiff finding.",

Support for pagination\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi, I have a typespec API which is a list api \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n listResources is ArmResourceActionSync\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    AutoAction,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    void,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    AutoActionResourceListResponse\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel AutoActionResourceListResponse is Azure.Core.Page\\\\\\\\u003cAutoActionResource\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis api needs to support pagination. How can I achieve that using Microsoft.TypeSpec.Providerhub.Controller? we use the package to generate our controllers, which doesn't let me add query parameters to our API\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe controller emitter will emit an endpoint for your action, but you will need to add an endpoint manually for the next page endpoint (which is, presumably, a GET).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nget is required for paging.  If you are not using GET, then automated paging mechanisms in ARM clients won't work.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIt's possible to use a different paging mechanism, but will require custom code in SDKs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntypespec-providerhub does not provide extra GET endpoints for resource actions that return lists - you would need to add this endpoint.  Since the controllers are partial, this should be fairly straightforward.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe question of whether RPaaS (providerhub) should support such an endpoint and typespec-providerhub should provide any required extension support for this is a good one.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#azure-resource-manager#reference#data-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Data types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-resource-manager/reference/data-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Data types\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ResourceManager\\\\\\\\n### `ResourceListResult` {#Azure.ResourceManager.ResourceListResult}\\\\\\\\n# libraries#azure-resource-manager#reference#data-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Data types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ResourceManager\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `ResourceListResult` {#Azure.ResourceManager.ResourceListResult}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPaged response containing resources\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Azure.ResourceManager.ResourceListResult\\\\\\\\u003cResource\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Template Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name     | Description                                                                |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Resource | The type of the values returned in the paged response (must be a resource) |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop list is ArmResourceActionSync\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Resource = Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Request = void,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  Response = ResourceListResult\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name      | Type                             | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| value     | `Array\\\\\\\\u003cElement\\\\\\\\u003e`                 |             |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| nextLink? | `TypeSpec.Rest.ResourceLocation` |             |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM-Models-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec ARM Model Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec ARM Model Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 42.

The link may encode parameters such as query parameters in HTTP.

TypeSpec's standard emitters (such as OpenAPI and HTTP) automatically apply Lifecycle visibility based on the context in which the model is used. Specifically, when a model is used as the response type of an operation (e.g., for GET), only properties marked with @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) will be included in the emitted schema. This is implicit and handled by the emitter, so you should simply annotate your model properties with the appropriate @visibility decorators, and the correct shape will be emitted for each operation context.\n\nFor example:\n\n```typespec\nmodel Example {\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\n  id: string;\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Read)\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n}\n\n@route(\"/example\")\ninterface Examples {\n  @get read(@path id: string): Example;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the OpenAPI emitter will automatically generate a response schema for GET that only includes properties with Lifecycle.Read visibility.

Defining your first resource\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Code explanation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some important points about the code:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `Widget` model has a `@resource` decorator with a parameter of `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"widgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. This string is the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"collection name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the resource and it determines where the resource appears in the service URI layout.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `name` property has a `@key` decorator with a parameter of `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"widgetName\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. This string customizes the name of the path parameter (and the parameter name itself) in operations that use this resource type. Note that there _must_ be one property with a `@key` decorator on all resource types!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` decorator on the `name` property indicates that the `name` property should only appear in operation responses, not in operations that allow you to change properties of the `Widget` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We use `@doc` decorators on the model type and all properties for description. Documentation strings are enforced by linting rule when authoring specs with `Azure.Core`!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow that we have a resource type, the next step is to define operations for this resource.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Built-in Data types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-data-types\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n### `Read` {#Read}\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#built-in-data-types.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Built-in Data types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `Read` {#Read}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA copy of the input model `T` with only the properties that are visible during the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Read\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" resource lifecycle phase.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Read\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" lifecycle phase is used for properties returned by operations that read data, like\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHTTP GET operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis transformation is recursive, and will include only properties that have the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`Lifecycle.Read` visibility modifier.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a `NameTemplate` is provided, the new model will be named according to the template.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe template uses the same syntax as the `@friendlyName` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Read\\\\\\\\u003cT, NameTemplate\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Template Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Name | Description |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|------|-------------|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| T | The model to transform. |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| NameTemplate | The name template to use for the new model.\\\\\\\\u003cbr /\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\u003cbr /\\\\\\\\u003e* |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Update)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  secretName: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// This model has the `id` and `name` fields, but not `secretName`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ReadDog is Read\\\\\\\\u003cDog\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Properties\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNone\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#visibility.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Visibility\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/visibility\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Visibility\\\\\\\\n## Lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#visibility.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a built-in visibility called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"resource lifecycle visibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This visibility allows you to declare\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nwhether properties are visible when passing a resource to or reading a resource from an API endpoint.

Here are some key points to consider:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Metadata is data about the data being transmitted. It can include information like the data's origin, when it was created or last updated, who created or updated it, and so on. Metadata is not usually visible to the end user, but it can be crucial for the system processing the data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility determines what data is visible to the end user or the system at any given time. For example, some data might be visible only to the system, some only to the end user, and some to both. Visibility can change depending on the context, such as whether the data is being created, read, updated, or deleted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `getRequestVisibility(HttpVerb): Visibility` API is used to determine the visibility implied for data in the request parameters or body. Note that `Visibility.Read` is always applied for response data, so there is no corresponding API for the response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo` API is used to create a metadata object for each program, which can then be used to reason about metadata and visibility implications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.getEffectivePayloadType(Type, Visibility): Type` API is used recursively on every type that is referenced. It recovers the named model when given an anonymous model sourced entirely from a single named model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)` API is used to check if a type undergoes any changes in shape due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nnamed model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)` API is used to check if a type undergoes any changes in shape due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isOptional(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to determine if a property is optional for the given visibility. This will differ from `ModelProperty.isOptional` when the Visibility is Update, in which case the property is always considered optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `Visibility.Item` flag is added when recursing into an array. This moves all metadata into the payload, which can be useful in scenarios like batching API calls.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBy understanding and correctly using these APIs and concepts, you can ensure that your emitter handles metadata and visibility consistently and effectively.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"standard-library#reference#typekits.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"[API] Typekits\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/reference/typekits\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# [API] Typekits\\\\\\\\n## model\\\\\\\\n### getEffectiveModel\\\\\\\\n# standard-library#reference#typekits.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# [API] Typekits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## model\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### getEffectiveModel\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`ts\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * If the input is anonymous (or the provided filter removes properties) and there exists a named model with the same set of properties (ignoring filtered properties), then return that named model.

It is used to determine when an emitter should include or exclude a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  property in a certain context.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility is defined using a _visibility class_. A visibility class is an `enum` that defines the visibility modifiers\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  (or flags) that can be applied to a property. Any `enum` can serve as a visibility class.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility classes have a _default_ visibility, which is the set of visibility modifiers that are applied _by default_\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  to a property if the visibility is not explicitly set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Lifecycle visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec provides a built-in visibility called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"resource lifecycle visibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This visibility allows you to declare\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nwhether properties are visible when passing a resource to or reading a resource from an API endpoint.

This visibility is checked, for\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  example, when a property is a parameter in an HTTP `GET` operation (**this should not be confused with an HTTP query\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameter defined using `@query`**).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Lifecycle visibility transforms\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can explicitly compute the shape of a model within a _specific_ lifecycle phase by using the four built-in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntemplates for lifecycle transforms:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Create\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Create` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Read\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Read` lifecycle phase,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Update\\\\\\\\u003cT extends Model\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that are visible in the `Update` lifecycle\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  phase, with the types of the properties set to `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have _either_ the `Create` or `Update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  visibility modifiers enabled, recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Delete\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Delete` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Query\\\\\\\\u003cT\\\\\\\\u003e`: creates a copy of `T` with only the properties that have the `Lifecycle.Query` modifier enabled,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  recursively.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create, Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Update)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  description: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ReadExample is Read\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateExample is Create\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel UpdateExample is Update\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel CreateOrUpdateExample is CreateOrUpdate\\\\\\\\u003cExample\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen you use these templates, the resulting models have no `Lifecycle` visibility modifiers applied, so that any\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemitters or libraries that use lifecycle visibility will not alter them further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Visibility modifiers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach property has its own set of _active visibility modifiers_ for each visibility class. The active modifiers can be\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nchanged using the decorators described in this section.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Note**: Changing the visibility for one visibility class _does not_ affect other visibility classes. If you change the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nvisibility for the `Lifecycle` visibility class, it will not affect the modifiers that are active for _any_ other\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nvisibility cla\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#http#operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/http/operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Operations\\\\\\\\n## Automatic visibility\\\\\\\\n# libraries#http#operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Automatic visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `@typespec/rest` library understands [Lifecycle Visibility](../../language-basics/visibility.md#lifecycle-visibility) and provides functionality for emitters to apply visibility transforms based on whether a model represents a request or response and on HTTP method usage as detailed in the table below.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSee [handling visibility and metadata](../../extending-typespec/emitter-metadata-handling.md) for details on how to incorporate this information into an emitter implementation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Modifier         | Visible in           |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ---------------- | -------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Read   | Any response         |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Query  | GET or HEAD request  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Create | POST or PUT request  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Update | PATCH or PUT request |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Lifecycle.Delete | DELETE request       |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis allows a single logical TypeSpec model to be used as in the following example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel User {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Create) password: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Users {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @post create(@path id: string, ...User): User;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @get get(@path id: string): User;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere is a single logical user entity represented by the single TypeSpec type `User`, but the HTTP payload for this entity varies based on context. When returned in a response, the `id` property is included, but when sent in a request, it is not. Similarly, the `password` property is only included in create requests, but not present in responses.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI v3 emitter will apply these visibilities automatically, without explicit use of `@withVisibility`, and it will generate separate schemas suffixed by visibility when necessary. `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` can be expressed in OpenAPI without generating additional schema by specifying `readOnly: true` and the OpenAPI v3 emitter will leverage this a an optimization, but other visibilities will generate additional schemas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nincluded in create requests, but not present in responses.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe OpenAPI v3 emitter will apply these visibilities automatically, without explicit use of `@withVisibility`, and it will generate separate schemas suffixed by visibility when necessary. `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` can be expressed in OpenAPI without generating additional schema by specifying `readOnly: true` and the OpenAPI v3 emitter will leverage this a an optimization, but other visibilities will generate additional schemas.

To understand how these features work, please refer to the TypeSpec-author documentation. This guide will help you integrate these features into your own emitter correctly.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe standard `/rest` library offers a JavaScript API for emitters to interpret APIs written using its decorators. We will focus on the APIs that are specifically relevant to these features.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen we say that emitters should handle things consistently, we mean they should agree on how data is transmitted and received. A TypeSpec _specification_ should serve as a reliable reference for these details. However, emitters can still _abstract_ things above this level and make different choices. For instance, the OpenAPI emitter may split a single TypeSpec model into multiple suffixed schemas like `UserCreate` and `UserUpdate`, while a client SDK emitter might emit a single `User` class that can be serialized to a request or deserialized from a response with different fields present in different situations. These features were specifically designed to allow a TypeSpec specification to be written in terms of logical entities that emitters could then maintain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Getting started\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're new to writing emitters, begin with the [emitter basics](./emitters-basics.md).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNext, examine the [REST metadata emitter sample](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/packages/samples/specs/rest-metadata-emitter). This sample uses all of the APIs discussed below to create a simple textual representation. It intentionally avoids splitting types like the OpenAPI emitter to highlight that this is not mandatory. Instead, it includes contextual comments to indicate how data depends on context.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHowever, if you want your emitter to split types like OpenAPI, you can still use the same API. Cross-referencing with the official [OpenAPI emitter](../emitters/openapi3/openapi.md) where these APIs are called can also be helpful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key API\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the main APIs involved in managing these features. For more details, refer to the linked API reference documentation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`resolveRequestVisibility(Program, Operation, HttpVerb): Visibility`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/functions/resolveRequestVisibility.md) - Use this to determine the visibility implied for data in the request parameters or body. Note that [`Visibility.Read`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/enumerations/Visibility.md) is always applied for response data, so there is no corresponding API for the response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`MetadataInfo`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/interfaces/MetadataInfo.md) - Create this once for each program using [`createMetadataInfo(Program, MetadataInfoOptions)`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/functions/createMetadataInfo.md). Then use it to understand metadata and visibility implications with the APIs below.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`MetadataInfo.getEffectivePayloadType(Type, Visibility): Type`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/interfaces/MetadataInfo.md#geteffectivepayloadtype) - Use this recursively on every referenced type. When given an anonymous model sourced entirely from a single named model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed, it will recover the named model. This handles the commonly discussed case of seeing that `op something(...Thing)` receives a `Thing` in its request body, among other cases.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/interfaces/MetadataInfo.md#istransformed) - Use this to check if a type undergoes any shape changes due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/interfaces/MetadataInfo.md#ispayloadproperty) - Use this to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Use this to check if a type undergoes any shape changes due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/interfaces/MetadataInfo.md#ispayloadproperty) - Use this to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`MetadataInfo.isOptional(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/interfaces/MetadataInfo.md#isoptional) - Use this to determine if a property is optional for the given visibility. This will differ from `ModelProperty.isOptional` when the Visibility is Update, in which case the property is always considered optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- [`Visibility.Item`](../libraries/http/reference/js-api/enumerations/Visibility.md) - Add this flag when recursing into an array. This moves all metadata into the payload, which can be useful in scenarios like batching API calls.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Working with metadata and visibility\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen working with metadata and visibility, it's important to understand how they interact with each other and with the data being transmitted. Here are some key points to consider:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Metadata is data about the data being transmitted. It can include information like the data's origin, when it was created or last updated, who created or updated it, and so on. Metadata is not usually visible to the end user, but it can be crucial for the system processing the data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Visibility determines what data is visible to the end user or the system at any given time. For example, some data might be visible only to the system, some only to the end user, and some to both. Visibility can change depending on the context, such as whether the data is being created, read, updated, or deleted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `getRequestVisibility(HttpVerb): Visibility` API is used to determine the visibility implied for data in the request parameters or body. Note that `Visibility.Read` is always applied for response data, so there is no corresponding API for the response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo` API is used to create a metadata object for each program, which can then be used to reason about metadata and visibility implications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.getEffectivePayloadType(Type, Visibility): Type` API is used recursively on every type that is referenced. It recovers the named model when given an anonymous model sourced entirely from a single named model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)` API is used to check if a type undergoes any changes in shape due to visibility or metadata. If not, this can allow for simplifications in emit.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isPayloadProperty(ModelProperty, Visibility): boolean` API is used to check if a property is transmitted as an object property in the payload and is not invisible or metadata sent elsewhere.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nnamed model after metadata is moved elsewhere or invisible properties are removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `MetadataInfo.isTransformed(Model, Visibility)` API is used to check if a type undergoes any changes in shape due to visibility or metadata.

This moves all metadata into the payload, which can be useful in scenarios like batching API calls.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBy understanding and correctly using these APIs and concepts, you can ensure that your emitter handles metadata and visibility consistently and effectively.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#api-specs#api-typespec.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"What is TypeSpec?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# What is TypeSpec?\\\\\\\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#api-specs#api-typespec.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# What is TypeSpec?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether you're working with Data Plane (DP) or Azure Resource Manager (ARM), having clear examples to follow can make your transition to TypeSpec smoother.

schemas are represented in TypeSpec by [models](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/models/).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nModels have any number of members and can extend and be composed with other models.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nModels can be defined with the `model` statement and then referenced by name, which generally results in a `$ref` to a schema for the model in the `definitions` or `components.schemas` section of the OpenAPI document.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec supports the [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"spread\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" operator](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/models/#spread) (`...`), which copies the members of the source model into the target model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBut TypeSpec processes all spread transformations before emitters are invoked, so this form of reuse is not represented in the emitted OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe spread operation is useful if you want one or more properties to be present in several different models but in a standard fashion. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Legs {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** number of legs */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  legs: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Dog {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Legs;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Cat {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Legs;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Snake {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // snakes have no legs\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### additionalProperties/unevaluatedProperties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can generate a schema with `additionalProperties` with the TypeSpec `Record` construct.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Note:** `unevaluatedProperties` is used instead of `additionalProperties` when emitting Open API 3.1 specs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar: Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nis produced as\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo get a schema having both `properties` and `additionalProperties`, define a model that extends `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Bar extends Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nproduces\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    bar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo define a schema with `additionalProperties` that has a specific type, use the `Record` construct with a type parameter.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar: Record\\\\\\\\u003cstring\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nresults in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo define a schema that **does not** allow any additional properties, use `Record\\\\\\\\u003cnever\\\\\\\\u003e`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  bar: Record\\\\\\\\u003cnever\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nresults in\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nbar:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  additionalProperties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    not: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the openapi3 emitter, schemas that don't define `additionalProperties` can automatically be set to `additionalProperties: { not: {} }` by setting the `seal-object-schemas` emitter option to `true`.

TCGC currently only supports examples based on HTTP payload, so the examples are available in `SdkHttpOperation.examples`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[`SdkHttpOperationExample`](../reference/js-api/interfaces/sdkhttpoperationexample/) represents an example. [`SdkHttpParameterExampleValue`](../reference/js-api/interfaces/sdkhttpparameterexamplevalue/), [`SdkHttpResponseExampleValue`](../reference/js-api/interfaces/sdkhttpresponseexamplevalue/), and [`SdkHttpResponseHeaderExampleValue`](../reference/js-api/interfaces/sdkhttpresponseheaderexamplevalue/) represent HTTP parameter, response body, and response header examples. Each type contains the example value and its corresponding definition type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[`SdkExampleValue`](../reference/js-api/type-aliases/sdkexamplevalue/) represents an example value of different types. All related types are used to represent the example value of a definition type. One definition type may have different example value types.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor [`SdkUnionExampleValue`](../reference/js-api/interfaces/sdkunionexamplevalue/), since it is difficult to determine which union variant the example value should belong to, TCGC preserves the raw value and leaves this determination to the emitter.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor [`SdkModelExampleValue`](../reference/js-api/interfaces/sdkmodelexamplevalue/), TCGC helps map the example type to the correct subtype for discriminated types and separates additional property values from property values. However, for models with inheritance, TCGC does not break down the type graph but instead places all example values in the child model.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Readonly on model\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Readonly on model\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Readonly on model\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have such swagger\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ReadonlyOnModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  readonly: true,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n},\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AnotherModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties: {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      $ref: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ReadonlyOnModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the type of property \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in another model is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ReadonlyOnModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", M4 will give a readonly on that property \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

Functionally (assuming all references to ReadOnlyModel are through readOnly properties),  these Swagger docs are equivalent, see: [autorest/docs/openapi/howto/$ref-siblings.md at main \\\\u00b7 Azure/autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/docs/openapi/howto/%24ref-siblings.md) from the perspective of both TypeSpec and autorest, these descriptions are equivalent.\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

Specifically, when a model is used as the response type of an operation (e.g., for GET), only properties marked with @visibility(Lifecycle.Read) will be included in the emitted schema.

            "answer": "1. **Model Validation Error (Additional Properties Not Allowed):**\n\nThe error about additional properties (groupIds, privateLinkServiceConnectionState, privateEndpoint, provisioningState) not being allowed typically occurs when your TypeSpec model does not correctly inherit from the common-types resource definition. For PrivateEndpointConnection, you should use the Azure template provided in `Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes` or `Azure.ResourceManager.PrivateEndpointConnectionResource` to ensure your model matches the expected schema and passes validation.\n\n**Best Practice:**\n- You can retain the name `PrivateEndpointConnection` in your namespace; the name itself does not affect validation as long as the model structure matches the common-types definition.\n- Some RPs rename the model for clarity or to avoid naming conflicts, but this is optional and not required for validation. The reviewer may guide you based on naming conventions, but structurally, you should inherit from the correct template.\n\n**Recommended TypeSpec Example:**\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\";\n\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeSigning;\n\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is Azure.ResourceManager.PrivateEndpointConnectionResource {}\n```\nThis ensures your model includes all required properties and matches the common-types schema.\n\n2. **Avocado Error (Removed API):**\n\nWhen you remove an API (e.g., `revokeCertificate`) and add a new one (`revokeCertificates`), Avocado will report this as a breaking change. If you do not need to support the older preview API, you can remove it entirely. If you must keep the older API for backward compatibility, you should suppress the Avocado error following the suppression guide:\n- See [Avocado known issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-Avocado#known-issues)\n- See [CI fix guide](https://aka.ms/ci-fix) for suppression instructions\n\n**Summary:**\n- Use the Azure common-types template for PrivateEndpointConnection and do not worry about renaming unless you have a naming conflict.\n- Fix the model validation by inheriting from the correct resource type.\n- For Avocado errors due to removed APIs, either remove the old API if not needed or suppress the error if you intentionally removed it.\n\nThis approach follows Azure TypeSpec and ARM guidelines and ensures your spec passes validation and review.",

The workflow is:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDesign your API in TypeSpec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGenerate an OpenApi doc by compiling your spec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRun oav to generate examples for each of the operations (oav generates syntactically valid examples with the 'operationId'  and 'title' fields filled in)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGo through the examples, replace values to make the examples more useful as documentation, and feel free to add  any examples for important scenarios that might be difficult to understand otherwise, or remove redundant examples (although you will need at least one per operation)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCopy the examples into the `examples/\\\\\\\\u003capi-version\\\\\\\\u003e/` folder inside your typespec directory and the OpenApi emitter will automatically associate the examples with  the appropriate operatiosn through the 'operationId' in the example file,  using the 'title' field as the title of the example.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_09_19.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Swagger LintDiff validation for certain models\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Swagger LintDiff validation for certain models\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_09_19.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Swagger LintDiff validation for certain models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nendpoint connection resource from the commonTypes/v5.

Prepare and submit a Pull Request for reviewing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Create a branch in your local repository for your changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. Create or update the TypeSpec files for your service.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Add or update 'examples' files for each operation of your OpenAPI file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   The [oav](https://github.com/Azure/oav) provides two ways to generate OpenAPI examples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set. Since the auto-generated\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     examples consist of random values for most types, you need replace them with meaningful values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       oav generate-examples openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Note, latest OAV tool should automatically generate the following. However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     please ensure you have:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `operationId`. This is used to match with declared operations in TypeSpec and correctly output in OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Add/update the `readme.md` file in the `{service}` folder to specify the version and location of the OpenAPI files. The `readme.md` is needed for both management-plane and data-plane services for REST API Docs generation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   Example:[sample-readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/widget/resource-manager/Microsoft.Widget/Widget/readme.md)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n5.

This will generate OpenAPI files under `{service}` folders.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n6. Ensure all generated files under `{service}` have been added to PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n7.

Instead, the typespec-autorest emitter automatically matches and inserts examples by operationId, see: x-ms-examples example files | TypeSpec Azure\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding how to control the values that will be generated in the examples. This is really an oav question, so notreally an expert, but I know there is a mechanism for con figuring examples, but you can find some details here: [Azure/oav: Tools for validating OpenAPI (Swagger) files](https://github.com/Azure/oav?tab=readme-ov-file#what-does-the-tool-do-what-issues-does-the-tool-catch). \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can also update values after the examples are generated.  There is also the api scenario mechanism which provides a bit more configurable example generation as part of servic eapi testing: [azure-rest-api-specs/documentation/api-scenario at main \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/documentation/api-scenario)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM-Private-PrivateEndpoints-Operations-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.Private.PrivateEndpoints Operations Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec Azure.ResourceManager.Private.PrivateEndpoints Operations Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 1.

there a way to suppress the missing APIs check only for this PR since it only has typspec conversion but no update to the open API spec?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe check is trying to compare the APIs with previous stable release with currently published stable release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPart of the typespec conversion is replacing the existing swagger with a generated swagger.  The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

For PrivateEndpointConnection, you should use the Azure template provided in `Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes` or `Azure.ResourceManager.PrivateEndpointConnectionResource` to ensure your model matches the expected schema and passes validation.\\\\n\\\\n**Best Practice:**\\\\n- You can retain the name `PrivateEndpointConnection` in your namespace; the name itself does not affect validation as long as the model structure matches the common-types definition.\\\\n- Some RPs rename the model for clarity or to avoid naming conflicts, but this is optional and not required for validation. The reviewer may guide you based on naming conventions, but structurally, you should inherit from the correct template.\\\\n\\\\n**Recommended TypeSpec Example:**\\\\n```typespec\\\\nimport \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeSigning;\\\\n\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is Azure.ResourceManager.PrivateEndpointConnectionResource {}\\\\n```\\\\nThis ensures your model includes all required properties and matches the common-types schema.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Avocado Error (Removed API):**\\\\n\\\\nWhen you remove an API (e.g., `revokeCertificate`) and add a new one (`revokeCertificates`), Avocado will report this as a breaking change. If you do not need to support the older preview API, you can remove it entirely. If you must keep the older API for backward compatibility, you should suppress the Avocado error following the suppression guide:\\\\n- See [Avocado known issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-Avocado#known-issues)\\\\n- See [CI fix guide](https://aka.ms/ci-fix) for suppression instructions\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Use the Azure common-types template for PrivateEndpointConnection and do not worry about renaming unless you have a naming conflict.\\\\n- Fix the model validation by inheriting from the correct resource type.\\\\n- For Avocado errors due to removed APIs, either remove the old API if not needed or suppress the error if you intentionally removed it.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach follows Azure TypeSpec and ARM guidelines and ensures your spec passes validation and review.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Looking at your PR, it seems that the avocado error is the only remaining one - this is just reporting that you have removed an API.  If you do not need to continue supporting the older preview, you might consider removing it,  otherwise, this is an error you can safely suppress (https://aka.ms/ci-fix is a great link to remember, as it has links to all kinds of useful info about ci errors, including a link to the suppression guides).\\\\nFor PrivateEndpointConnections, RPs have done both, as the name of the private endpoint connection type doesn't really matter to the API, however, there is a new template that greatly simplifies adding private endpoint connection operations to any resourc,e see:\\\\n[typespec-azure/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-end\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/blob/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-endpoints.tsp#L69-L94)\\\\n```\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointConnectionResource;\\\\nalias PrivateEndpointOperations = PrivateEndpoints<PrivateEndpointConnection>;\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\nget is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;\\\\ncreateOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;\\\\nupdate is ArmCustomPatchSync<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nAzure.ResourceManager.Foundations.ResourceUpdateModel<Employee, EmployeeProperties>\\\\n>;\\\\ndelete is ArmResourceDeleteSync<Employee>;\\\\nlistByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;\\\\nlistBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;\\\\n/** A sample resource action that move employee to different location */\\\\nmove is ArmResourceActionSync<Employee, MoveRequest, MoveResponse>;\\\\n/** A sample HEAD operation to check resource existence */\\\\ncheckExistence is ArmResourceCheckExistence<Employee>;\\\\ngetPrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.Read<Employee>;\\\\ncreateOrUpdatePrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.CreateOrUpdateAsync<Employee>;\\\\nupdatePrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.CustomPatchAsync<Employee>;\\\\ndeletePrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointOperations.DeleteAsync<Employee>;\\\\nlistPrivateEndpointConnections is PrivateEndpointOperations.ListByParent<Employee>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nSee here for the Avocado error.

            "answer": "For a TypeSpec conversion PR that does not update the OpenAPI spec, the Avocado 'missing APIs in default tag' check is triggered because the generated swagger is compared against previous releases to ensure API equivalence. During TypeSpec conversion, the generated swagger should be functionally equivalent, but not necessarily identical, to the previous swagger. If the missing APIs error is a false positive (i.e., the APIs are present but Avocado fails to detect them due to conversion artifacts), you can suppress this check for your PR by adding the 'Approved-Avocado' label. This is the recommended approach for TypeSpec conversion PRs where no actual API changes are made, and the error is due to tooling limitations rather than a real API gap. However, you should still review the generated swagger to confirm that no APIs are actually missing and that the conversion is accurate.",

Specific validation rules do not apply to your service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   (e.g. ARM specific API validation rules may not apply to data plane API validation).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. You are blocked on resolving this issue by external teams\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   (e.g. ARM feature that would need to be let up for you to become green).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. If you believe that the validation is a false positive (incorrect failure due to a bug in the tool).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n5. If you service is RPaaS service and you're blocked by a new validation rule.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Invalid reasons\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are trying to suppress failures that do not fall under one of the valid cases enumerated\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin previous section, and the following applies to your case, then suppression will **not** be approved:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. You can't resolve the violations at the moment due to time constraints and planning to do it in the future.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. The violation reported applies to your case and is not a false positive.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3.

The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Suppress

            "answer": "The best practice for implementing an update (PATCH) operation for a resource with a discriminator (polymorphic resource) in Azure ARM TypeSpec is to use the legacy discriminated resource models provided by the Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy library. Specifically, you should define your Host resource using `DiscriminatedTrackedResource` (for tracked resources) or `DiscriminatedProxyResource` (for proxy resources), which automatically include the required discriminator property (usually `kind`) and ensure the OpenAPI output is correct.\n\nWhen using `ArmResourcePatchAsync` for a discriminated resource, you must ensure that the PATCH request body includes the required discriminator property definition. If you use a plain model with a discriminator, the PATCH schema may omit the required property, causing OAV to fail with `OBJECT_MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY_DEFINITION`.\n\nHere is the recommended TypeSpec pattern:\n\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\";\n\nmodel Host is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.DiscriminatedTrackedResource {\n  // Add resource-specific properties here\n  properties: HostProperties;\n}\n\nmodel HostProperties {\n  // Host-specific properties\n  ...\n}\n\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Hosts {\n  get is ArmResourceRead<Host>;\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Host>;\n  update is ArmResourcePatchAsync<Host, HostProperties>;\n  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Host>;\n  listByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Host>;\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Host>;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the PATCH schema includes the discriminator property (e.g., `kind`) as required, and OAV will not fail with missing required property errors. If you need to further customize the PATCH request body, use `ArmCustomPatchAsync` and ensure the custom patch model includes the discriminator property.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Always use the legacy discriminated resource models for polymorphic ARM resources.\n- The PATCH operation must include the discriminator property in the request body schema.\n- Do not use a plain model with just `@discriminator` for ARM resources; use the provided legacy types.\n\nThis pattern is fully compliant with Azure ARM and OpenAPI guidelines for PATCH operations on polymorphic resources.",

I tried ArmResourcePatchAsync, but the resource has a discriminator. oav fails with OBJECT_MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY_DEFINITION .  [Windows Server AHB for VMware via PATCH by cataggar \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #25538 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-sp\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/25538)\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"The best practice for implementing an update (PATCH) operation for a resource with a discriminator (polymorphic resource) in Azure ARM TypeSpec is to use the legacy discriminated resource models provided by the Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy library. Specifically, you should define your Host resource using `DiscriminatedTrackedResource` (for tracked resources) or `DiscriminatedProxyResource` (for proxy resources), which automatically include the required discriminator property (usually `kind`) and ensure the OpenAPI output is correct.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using `ArmResourcePatchAsync` for a discriminated resource, you must ensure that the PATCH request body includes the required discriminator property definition. If you use a plain model with a discriminator, the PATCH schema may omit the required property, causing OAV to fail with `OBJECT_MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY_DEFINITION`.\\\\n\\\\nHere is the recommended TypeSpec pattern:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nimport \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nmodel Host is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.DiscriminatedTrackedResource {\\\\n  // Add resource-specific properties here\\\\n  properties: HostProperties;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nmodel HostProperties {\\\\n  // Host-specific properties\\\\n  ...\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Hosts {\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead<Host>;\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Host>;\\\\n  update is ArmResourcePatchAsync<Host, HostProperties>;\\\\n  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Host>;\\\\n  listByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Host>;\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Host>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis approach ensures that the PATCH schema includes the discriminator property (e.g., `kind`) as required, and OAV will not fail with missing required property errors. If you need to further customize the PATCH request body, use `ArmCustomPatchAsync` and ensure the custom patch model includes the discriminator property.\\\\n\\\\n**Key points:**\\\\n- Always use the legacy discriminated resource models for polymorphic ARM resources.\\\\n- The PATCH operation must include the discriminator property in the request body schema.\\\\n- Do not use a plain model with just `@discriminator` for ARM resources; use the provided legacy types.\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern is fully compliant with Azure ARM and OpenAPI guidelines for PATCH operations on polymorphic resources.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"we generally suggest that PATCH requests over discriminated types should require the discriminator property.  This may result in some lintdiff violations, but that is expected, and those cna be suppressed.  This is especially true if, as most services, your PATCH operation would need the discriminator value on the wire to determine how to apply the PATCH request to the existing reosurce.\\\"}\"}]",

The properties of a resource define the allowed properties and their types in a Patch request body for that resource as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `type` of a property indicates the allowed type of the corresponding property in a Patch request.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Required` properties without a default value are _optional_ in a Patch request, but if present, the value cannot be null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `Optional` properties are _optional_ in a Patch request, and, if present, can contain any valid value or null.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Properties with a default value are _optional_ in a Patch request, but have no default value in the request body.

Violating these rules results in **errors** to be flagged by the automated checks and blocks the OpenAPI spec PRs from getting approved. All `Recommended` rules are strong suggestions, some of which are also automated using linter rules. Violating these rules results in **warnings** to be flagged by the automated checks.

All rules that are in scope for the design phase automatically imply that the runtime will also adhere to it.

Only the property set that really needs an update are specified in a `Patch` payload thereby limiting the surface area of any potential impact. Violating these rules result in APIs across Azure becoming inconsistent with each other. Such inconsistencies degrade customer experience as they now have to deal with slightly different behaviors while interacting with each Resource Provider. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cbr\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| RPC Guideline code | Title | Conformance level | Additional impact |  Applicable scope | Linter rule |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| RPC-Patch-V1-01 | The request body **must** contain at least one or more properties.

Specifically, you should define your Host resource using `DiscriminatedTrackedResource` (for tracked resources) or `DiscriminatedProxyResource` (for proxy resources), which automatically include the required discriminator property (usually `kind`) and ensure the OpenAPI output is correct.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using `ArmResourcePatchAsync` for a discriminated resource, you must ensure that the PATCH request body includes the required discriminator property definition. If you use a plain model with a discriminator, the PATCH schema may omit the required property, causing OAV to fail with `OBJECT_MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY_DEFINITION`.\\\\n\\\\nHere is the recommended TypeSpec pattern:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nimport \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nmodel Host is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.DiscriminatedTrackedResource {\\\\n  // Add resource-specific properties here\\\\n  properties: HostProperties;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nmodel HostProperties {\\\\n  // Host-specific properties\\\\n  ...\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Hosts {\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead<Host>;\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Host>;\\\\n  update is ArmResourcePatchAsync<Host, HostProperties>;\\\\n  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Host>;\\\\n  listByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Host>;\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Host>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis approach ensures that the PATCH schema includes the discriminator property (e.g., `kind`) as required, and OAV will not fail with missing required property errors. If you need to further customize the PATCH request body, use `ArmCustomPatchAsync` and ensure the custom patch model includes the discriminator property.\\\\n\\\\n**Key points:**\\\\n- Always use the legacy discriminated resource models for polymorphic ARM resources.\\\\n- The PATCH operation must include the discriminator property in the request body schema.\\\\n- Do not use a plain model with just `@discriminator` for ARM resources; use the provided legacy types.\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern is fully compliant with Azure ARM and OpenAPI guidelines for PATCH operations on polymorphic resources.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"we generally suggest that PATCH requests over discriminated types should require the discriminator property.  This may result in some lintdiff violations, but that is expected, and those cna be suppressed.  This is especially true if, as most services, your PATCH operation would need the discriminator value on the wire to determine how to apply the PATCH request to the existing reosurce.\\\"}\"}]",

Until then, we recommend you [suppress](https://aka.ms/pr-suppressions) these LintDiff errors, using a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"permanent suppression\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with a descriptive \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"reason\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAdditionalProperties`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe use of `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e` in TypeSpec is discouraged, and there is a TypeSpec lint rule to enforce this.  If you still need to use `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e`, the OpenAPI spec generated will cause many LintDiff errors of types `AvoidAdditionalProperties` and `PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition`.  You will need to suppress both the TypeSpec violation (in TypeSpec source code) and the LintDiff violations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAnonymousParameter`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### data-plane\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData-plane specs can suppress violations of this rule, since it only exists for the benefit of SDKs generated from swagger, and data-plane SDKs are generated directly from TypeSpec.  Resource-manager specs should **not** suppress violations of this rule, since resource-manager SDKs are generated from OpenAPI, and rely on these errors being fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### resource-manager\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs an exception to the previous note, resource-manager specs **may** be able to suppress `AvoidAnonymousTypes`, but only if the error is inside a 202 response from a long-running operation (LRO).  It is known that SDKs do not need to generate type names for such responses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAnonymousTypes`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData-plane specs can suppress violations of this rule, since it only exists for the benefit of SDKs generated from swagger, and data-plane SDKs are generated directly from TypeSpec.  Resource-manager specs should **not** suppress violations of this rule, since resource-manager SDKs are generated from OpenAPI, and rely on these errors being fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `LongRunningResourceAction`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a known issue where `LongRunningResourceAction` in TypeSpec, generates swagger that causes `AvoidAnonymousTypes`.  These errors should be suppressed until the root cause is fixed.  https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure-pr/issues/3349\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `EvenSegmentedPathForPutOperation`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `EvenSegmentedPathForPutOperation` is failing for OpenAPI generated from TypeSpec using `@singleton` (OpenAPI path ends with `/default`), we believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/646\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `IntegerTypeMustHaveFormat`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData-plane specs can suppress violations of this rule, since it only exists for the benefit of SDKs generated from swagger, and data-plane SDKs are generated directly from TypeSpec.  Resource-manager specs should **not** suppress violations of this rule, since resource-manager SDKs are generated from OpenAPI, and rely on these errors being fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `PatchBodyParameterSchema`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe root cause is a bug in typespec-azure:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/issues/383.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPlease see the issue above for the suggested workaround and apply it directly to the spec TypeSpec sources.  The LintDiff error should **not** be ignored or suppressed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `PatchPropertiesCorrespondToPutProperties`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/642\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe use of `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e` in TypeSpec is discouraged, and there is a TypeSpec lint rule to enforce this.  If you still need to use `Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e`, the OpenAPI spec generated will cause many LintDiff errors of types `AvoidAdditionalProperties` and `PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition`.  You will need to suppress both the TypeSpec violation (in TypeSpec source code) and the LintDiff violations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe root cause is a limitation in how `azure-openapi-validator` and `oav` handle `$ref` siblings:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/637\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- https://github.com/Azure/oav/issues/848\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe recommended workaround is to add `use-read-only-status-schema: true` to your `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `RequestBodyMustExistForPutPatch`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe this is a false positive: https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/641\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `ResourceNameRestriction`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether `ResourceNameRestriction` should be applied to enums is an open question:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/issues/501\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/pull/714\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUntil this is resolved, suppress the errors and discuss with your ARM reviewer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `XmsEnumValidation`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec using `OAuth2Auth` may generate the following OpenAPI:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"OAuth2 authentication\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"enum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"oauth2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n},\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhich causes error `XmsEnumValidation`.

                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Project Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can define certain parameters that can subsequently be specified through the CLI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nParameters can be organized in a nested structure, to access different levels of the structure, use dots (`.`) in the variable expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTherefore, parameter names should not contain `.` in their name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be utilized in the default value of these parameters.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese parameters can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll parameters must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  base-dir:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {base-dir}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe parameter can then be specified via `--arg` in this format `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` and for nested structures `--arg

variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can specify which environment variables it can interpolate.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be used in the default value of these environment variables.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese environment variables can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression, using the `env.` prefix.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll environment variables must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenvironment-variables:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  BASE_DIR:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {env.BASE_DIR}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Emitter Options\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCertain emitter configurations can be interpolated using a specific rule designed to collapse a path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a variable is succeeded by a `/` or `.` and the emitter responsible for interpolating the config doesn't supply that variable, the path segment will be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, consider the following config value: `{service-name}/output.{version}.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's what would be produced:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Service name value | Version value | Result                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`        | `PetStore/output.v1.json` |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       |

The interesting thing is, the place I'm violating the rules, its swagger is the same as before. Why these violations are not reported before?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe LintDiff errors in your PR are not necessarily new violations. Many of them already existed in the main branch, but previously, CI failures weren\\\\u2019t blocking, so these issues were effectively allowed to persist unnoticed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nNow, because your PR is part of a TypeSpec (TSP) migration, the generated Swagger includes many differences\\\\u2014over 3,000 diffs in total\\\\u2014due to normalization by the AutoRest emitter. These changes are functionally equivalent but not textually identical, which makes it hard for the LintDiff auto-baselining algorithm to recognize unchanged areas. As a result, you\\\\u2019re seeing errors flagged as new, even if the same issues existed in main.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nGiven the unreliability of the auto-baselining mechanism, we recommend not depending on it. Instead, all LintDiff errors\\\\u2014regardless of whether they are newly introduced or pre-existing\\\\u2014should be explicitly suppressed in the `readme.md` file. This is the mitigation approach we advise for all PRs, especially TSP migrations.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Typespec Validation required check\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Typespec Validation required check\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Typespec Validation required check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/{module-name}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" does not match \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/{service-dir}/{package-dir}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

Specifically, the PR author needs to ensure their membership in the Azure GitHub organization is set to public (not private), and they must join the Azure SDK Partners group. Without these steps, the CI pipelines will not trigger or report status, blocking the merge.\n\nTo resolve this:\n1. Make sure the PR author's Azure organization membership is public. You can verify this at https://github.com/orgs/Azure/people?query=AbhishekSinha-AEP.\n2. Join the Azure SDK Partners group by following the instructions at https://aka.ms/azsdk/access.\n\nOnce these steps are completed, the required checks should start and report status, allowing you to proceed with merging your PR.",

To fix this issue, remove the duplicate header definition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## duplicate-type-name\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when a schema or parameter name is a duplicate of another schema or parameter. This generally happens when a model or parameter is renamed with the `@friendlyName` decorator, resulting in two different TypeSpec types getting the same name in the OpenAPI output.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, change the name or friendly-name of one of the models or parameters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@friendlyName(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"User\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Customer {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel User {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, both `Customer` and `User` would appear as `User` in the OpenAPI output, causing a conflict.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## inline-cycle\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when a cyclic reference is detected within inline schemas.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, refactor the schemas to remove the cyclic reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncomponents:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  schemas:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Node:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        value:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        next:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          $ref: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#/components/schemas/Node\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, the `Node` schema references itself, creating a cyclic reference. To fix this issue, refactor the schema to remove the cyclic reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## invalid-default\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when a default value is invalid for the specified schema type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, ensure that the default value is valid for the schema type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncomponents:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  schemas:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    User:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        age:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          type: integer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"twenty\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, the `default` value for the `age` property is invalid because it is a string instead of an integer. To fix this issue, provide a valid default value, such as `20`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## invalid-extension-key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued by the `@extension` decorator when the extension key does not start with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nrequired by the OpenAPI v3 specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, change the extension name to start with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"invalid-name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel User {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nShould be changed to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-valid-name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel User {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## invalid-schema\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when a schema is invalid according to the OpenAPI v3 specification.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, review your TypeSpec definitions to ensure they map to valid OpenAPI schemas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncomponents:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  schemas:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    User:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      type: object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      properties:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        id:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        age:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          type: integer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          format: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"int\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" # Invalid format\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this example, the `format` value for the `age` property is invalid. To fix this issue, provide a valid format value such as `int32` or `int64`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## invalid-server-variable\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when a variable in the `@server` decorator is not defined as a string type.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSince server variables are substituted into the server URL which is a string, all variables must have string values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, make sure all server variables are of a type that is assignable to `string`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@server(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{protocol}://{host}/api/{version}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Custom endpoint\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  protocol: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  host: string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  version: 1, // Should be a string: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## path-query\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when the OpenAPI emitter finds an `@route` decorator that specifies a path that contains a query parameter. This is not permitted by the OpenAPI v3 specification, which requires query parameters to be defined separately.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, redesign the API to only use paths without query parameters, and define query parameters using the `@query` decorator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstead of:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/users?filter={filter}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop getUsers(filter: string): User[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop getUsers(@query filter?: string): User[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, you can leverage TypeSpec's support for URI templates:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/users{?filter}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop getUsers(filter?: string): User[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## union-null\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when the result of model composition is effectively a `null` schema which cannot be\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nrepresented in OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, review your model compositions to ensure they produce valid schemas with actual properties or types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## union-unsupported\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis diagnostic is issued when the OpenAPI emitter finds a union of two incompatible types that cannot be represented in OpenAPI. OpenAPI has limited support for union types, and some combinations cannot be expressed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo fix this issue, consider restructuring your types to avoid incompatible unions, or split the operation into multiple operations with different return types.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Suppress validation failures on a PR\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Suppress validation failures on a PR\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Suppress validation failures on a PR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e This article assumes you came here from your REST API specs PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e See [this documentation section description](xref:specs-pr-guides) for details.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOn your Azure REST API specs PR, some of the GitHub check failures (see the `Checks` tab on your PR) can be suppressed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe suppression can be either just for the PR, or permanent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## To suppress given validation failure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

If previous example's `nextLink` value isn't a valid URI, it will cause a validation error.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Resolution\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nChoose one of the following options:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Update your example** to include a valid URI value, or\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. **Modify your TypeSpec response model** to use a custom definition if the nextLink returned by the service is not a URI:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel ResponseModel {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @pageItems\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  value: ItemType[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @nextLink\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  nextLink?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### INVALID_FORMAT: Object didn't pass validation for format arm-id\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Root Cause\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis error typically occurs when a custom resource definition is mapped to a resource defined in common-types. See [this section](./breakingchange.md#using-resources-from-common-types) for details. The `id` property for `Resource` in common-types may use the `arm-id` format, depending on the version of common-types used.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Resolution\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUpdate the value in the example file to meet the `arm-id` format requirements.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"bad\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# bad\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# bad\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- path: data-plane/**/*.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen in doubt, search the repo for examples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nhttps://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAzure%2Fazure-rest-api-specs+path%3A%2F%28%5E%7C%5C%2F%29suppressions%5C.yaml%24%2F\\\\\\\\u0026type=code\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `TypeSpec Requirement` check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo suppress `TypeSpec Requirement` check for given pattern of OpenAPI spec .json file paths, provide an entry with\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`tool` set to `TypeSpecRequirement`.

Specific validation rules do not apply to your service\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   (e.g. ARM specific API validation rules may not apply to data plane API validation).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. You are blocked on resolving this issue by external teams\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   (e.g. ARM feature that would need to be let up for you to become green).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4.

You can't resolve the violations at the moment due to time constraints and planning to do it in the future.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.

Specifically, patterns like {width}x{height} or {x}/{y}@{scale}x in your API paths are now breaking validation due to stricter parsing rules introduced in path-to-regexp@6.2.1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPreviously, your spec passed validation because older versions of path-to-regexp were more lenient. The recent update introduced security fixes that inadvertently caused this break.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo unblock your PR, we\\\\u2019ve deployed a temporary fix that pins path-to-regexp to an older version. This means your Swagger checks should no longer crash. Meanwhile, we\\\\u2019re working on a permanent solution that doesn\\\\u2019t rely on pinning old code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you still need to validate locally, you can manually install the older version and run oav like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cinstall node 20\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmkdir testdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncd testdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnpm i oav path-to-regexp@6.2.2\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnpx oav validate-example /path/to/your/openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, you can use validate-spec instead of validate-example if you're checking the spec directly. This workaround has been confirmed to pass for your PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ve also applied the approved-modelvalidation and approved-semanticvalidation labels to your PR to unblock progress. Just note that if other issues surface later due to this regression, you may need to address them in a follow-up PR.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_09_12.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"SDK Validation steps are failing with not much helpful logs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# SDK Validation steps are failing with not much helpful logs\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_09_12.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# SDK Validation steps are failing with not much helpful logs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\u2019re in the process of creating a new API version within our RP.

There is no strict requirement in the referenced documentation that all resource providers (including ring 0 services like Microsoft.Compute) must have their specs present in RPaaSMaster if they have received an explicit exemption from RPaaS onboarding. The documentation and FAQ state that if your service is not onboarded to RPaaS (and has an exception), you do not need to merge your specs into RPaaSMaster. The presence or absence of Microsoft.Compute in RPaaSMaster does not dictate requirements for other RPs; each spec owner is responsible for their own onboarding and branch sync according to their onboarding status and exemptions. If your ring 0 service has an approved exception, you can continue to manage your specs in 'main' and do not need to merge into RPaaSMaster unless instructed otherwise by the ARM or EngSys team.",

The Avocado check (MULTIPLE_API_VERSION) was recently made a blocking error to enforce this policy.\nTo temporarily suppress this failure and unblock your PR, you can add the Approved-Avocado label to your PR. However, this is only a one-time suppression and should be done if:\nThere is an ongoing discussion and plan to resolve the uniform versioning issue for Compute.\nYou or your team are aware that this is a temporary measure and are working towards compliance.\nImportant: Regular use of this suppression is discouraged. The long-term solution is to restructure your API versions so all components under Compute adopt a uniform versioning scheme, or split into independent services as outlined in the Uniform Versioning Violation Guide.\nIf you are not aware of any ongoing discussion or plan for resolution, you should reach out to azversioning@service.microsoft.com for guidance.",

In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_rest_api_specs_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"API-Spec-Review-FAQ.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/API-Spec-Review-FAQ\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ARM team right now | PRs are generally reviewed in order of the ARM queue.

The generated swagger is still used for some purposes, and Avocado protects the ability to process it. The generated swagger needs to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical.  Generally these issues reflected in the swagger will also show up in breaking change checks, which will have to be resolved (or suppressed if they are false positives)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Suppress validation failures on a PR\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Suppress validation failures on a PR\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Suppress validation failures on a PR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e This article assumes you came here from your REST API specs PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e See [this documentation section description](xref:specs-pr-guides) for details.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOn your Azure REST API specs PR, some of the GitHub check failures (see the `Checks` tab on your PR) can be suppressed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe suppression can be either just for the PR, or permanent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## To suppress given validation failure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\n\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\n\nThe correct and supported approach is:\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\n\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\n```\n\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\n\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation in tspconfig.yaml until you are ready to onboard SDKs.",

            "answer": "For ARM (management-plane) APIs in private preview, SDK generation is NOT required for API approval. Azure guidelines explicitly state that private preview versions do not require corresponding SDK package versions, and there are no SDK support requirements at this stage. You can safely proceed without SDK emitter configuration in your tspconfig.yaml.\n\nHowever, the TypeSpec validation system expects certain emitter options to be present in tspconfig.yaml, even if you do not intend to generate SDKs. If you remove these options, you may encounter validation failures (e.g., SdkTspConfigValidation errors).\n\nTo resolve this, you have two options:\n\n1. **Suppress SDK validation rules for emitters you do not support**: Add a suppressions.yaml file in your service folder and explicitly suppress the relevant SdkTspConfigValidation sub-rules for each SDK emitter you do not support (e.g., Go, Java, .NET, JS). Example:\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  sub-rules:\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\n    # Add similar lines for other emitters as needed\n  reason: 'No SDK required for private preview.'\n```\n\n2. **(Not recommended) Add minimal emitter options**: You could add placeholder emitter options for each required SDK emitter, but this is discouraged if you do not intend to generate SDKs.\n\n**Best Practice:** Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation for emitters not in scope. This is the recommended approach for private preview ARM APIs.\n\nWhen you are ready to onboard SDK generation (e.g., for public preview or GA), you should add the appropriate emitter options to tspconfig.yaml following the Azure SDK guidelines.\n\nSummary: API approval for private preview does NOT require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to pass TypeSpec validation without SDK emitter configs.",

Azure guidelines explicitly state that private preview versions do not require corresponding SDK package versions, and there are no SDK support requirements at this stage. You can safely proceed without SDK emitter configuration in your tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the TypeSpec validation system expects certain emitter options to be present in tspconfig.yaml, even if you do not intend to generate SDKs. If you remove these options, you may encounter validation failures (e.g., SdkTspConfigValidation errors).\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this, you have two options:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Suppress SDK validation rules for emitters you do not support**: Add a suppressions.yaml file in your service folder and explicitly suppress the relevant SdkTspConfigValidation sub-rules for each SDK emitter you do not support (e.g., Go, Java, .NET, JS).

Use suppressions.yaml to pass TypeSpec validation without SDK emitter configs.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\\\\n\\\\nThe correct and supported approach is:\\\\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\\\\n\\\\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation.

Each SDK package version must clearly document which service version it targets .\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - When any preview or GA version of a service is retired, the corresponding SDK package version is deprecated (without affecting any other SDK packages). Note that Azure retires preview service versions regularly; GA service versions are retired when breaking changes are introduced or on other rare occasions. See [Azure SDK lifecycle and support policy](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_support.html#azure-sdk-lifecycle-and-support-policy).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - When a service is retired in its entirety, all SDK packages for this service are deprecated (without affecting any other services\\\\u2019 SDK packages).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - A service version introducing a breaking change will likely break that service\\\\u2019s SDK package in the next version causing the new SDK package version to increment its major number as per semantic versioning. This also causes old preview and GA service versions and their corresponding SDK package versions to be retired/deprecated.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The above service and SDK package versioning rules simplify the usage and ongoing maintenance of downstream consumers such as the Azure Portal, Azure CLI/PowerShell, Azure Developer CLI, ARM templates, Bicep, 3rd party libraries that wrap our Azure REST APIs and SDK packages (such as Terraform/Pulumi), etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nto increment its major number as per semantic versioning.

If you want to assign a default value to a required field, you\\\\u2019ll need to use the \\\\u201cremove/rename dance\\\\u201d workaround, as shown in the referenced playground. This means you\\\\u2019ll have to remove the old field and reintroduce it with a default value, which is not ideal but currently the only way.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCan we delete unused preview versions and only keep the latest one?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYes, absolutely. That is what we recommend. Azure services are moving toward maintaining only one active preview version per spec (except for ARM retention requirements, which typically apply only to public previews). Since you\\\\u2019re still in private preview and none of your previous versions are being used, you can safely remove them and keep only the latest one.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDeprecation only matters if you have customers using those versions. For private previews, there are no SDK support requirements. You can simply remove the older versions from your TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s the process for moving to public preview?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou should open a PR against the public repo\\\\u2019s main branch before the public preview announcement. You can start preparing Microsoft Learn documentation using the versions merged in the RPSaaSMaster branch. The review process for public preview is slightly easier if you\\\\u2019ve already been reviewed privately, but it does include required SDK checks.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou should only bring over the latest preview version to the public repo. It\\\\u2019s fine to omit .tsp files in the public repo if they\\\\u2019re not needed.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_rest_api_specs_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Deprecating-Preview-APIs.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Process\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Deprecating-Preview-APIs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"## Process\\\\\\\\n1.

If the ongoing PRs are targeting to a release-* or dev-* branch which are not created or syncing from the latest main, we recommend to merge these PRs first.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.

Merge latest main \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          git checkout main\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          git pull origin main // origin points to Azure rest api specs repo.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          git merge main \\\\\\\\u003cyour-pr-branch\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      2. Resolve conflicts  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        - For most of the conflicts, accept the incoming changes.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        - If it's unclear, please accept both and then update based on your judgement with the folder structure changes above.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      3. Make sure the new change is aligned with folder structure v2  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n         There are some cases where the PR is adding a new version in the original location, but the file diffs don't show as conflict. we should move them into the correct place so that it doesn't break the folder structure v2 as instructions in **Understanding Folder Migration sections** \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      4. clean up the previous folder if exists.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important**: It's strongly recommended to understand what's really changed in the folder refactor. Always ensure the new PR doesn't include any things that breaks the folder structure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### After Resolution\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to compile the TypeSpec project so that the TypeSpec Validation could pass.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Comprehensive validation**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#generate-with-tsp-client#intro_tsp_client.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Usage\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-with-tsp-client/intro_tsp_client\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Usage\\\\\\\\n## Prerequisites\\\\\\\\n# howtos#generate-with-tsp-client#intro_tsp_client.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Usage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Prerequisites\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsers working with a repository that already accepts this tool can continue to the [Usage](#usage) section.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRepo owners should follow the steps in the [tsp-client repo setup](./repo_setup.md) doc.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#api-spec-gen-sdk-config.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"SDK generation configuration\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-spec-gen-sdk-config\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# SDK generation configuration\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#api-spec-gen-sdk-config.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# SDK generation configuration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo generate SDK code based on REST API specifications, you need to configure the corresponding files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For TypeSpec, the configuration file is `tspconfig.yaml`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For OpenAPI, the configuration file is `readme.md`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Enable SDK generation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e[!IMPORTANT]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e You cannot enable SDK generation for both TypeSpec and OpenAPI simultaneously.

Each service has versions (some preview and some GA) and each version has its own API contract, documentation, and (beta/stable) SDK package(s).   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo enforce these rules, here are some notes about the repo structure:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\\\\\tIn the resource-manager folder, if it's a RPaaS service, there must be just 1 readme.md file, and 1+ service name folders under resource-manager/RPnamespace folder, but the resource types within each service folder must not duplicate except for operations, locations, checkNameAvailability etc. Which is required by RPaaS for HTTP request schema validation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.\\\\\\\\tIn the data-plane folder there must be no files and at least 1 service name folder.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3.\\\\\\\\tThe ServiceName folder must have only readme.*, tspconfig.yaml and *.tsp files in it. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - In the readme.md file, the latest package tag value (which represents a service version) must refer to OpenAPI files that are all in the exact same folder. Also, if the tag value is suffixed with \\\\u201c-preview\\\\u201d then all the OpenAPI paths must refer to files in the preview subfolder; else all OpenAPI paths must refer to files in the stable subfolder.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - If 2+ services want to \\\\u201cshare\\\\u201d some TypeSpec/OpenAPI files, these files must be explicitly copied into a consuming service\\\\u2019s folder on its desired timeline. We do not allow multiple services to reference a single copy of a service contract because it is too dangerous to allow one service to change a shared contract, forcing other services to pick up this shared contract instantly, especially if the shared contract introduces breaking changes. Each service must be in control of its own destiny.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"good\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/specs-pr-guides/pr-suppressions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# good\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#specs-pr-guides#pr-suppressions.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# good\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- path: data-plane/Azure.Contoso.WidgetManager/preview/2022-11-01-preview/**/*.json\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_rest_api_specs_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Swagger-LintDiff.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAnonymousParameter`\\\\\\\\n### resource-manager\\\\\\\\n# Swagger-LintDiff.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## `AvoidAnonymousParameter`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### resource-manager\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs an exception to the previous note, resource-manager specs **may** be able to suppress `AvoidAnonymousTypes`, but only if the error is inside a 202 response from a long-running operation (LRO).

Azure guidelines explicitly state that private preview versions do not require corresponding SDK package versions, and there are no SDK support requirements at this stage. You can safely proceed without SDK emitter configuration in your tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the TypeSpec validation system expects certain emitter options to be present in tspconfig.yaml, even if you do not intend to generate SDKs. If you remove these options, you may encounter validation failures (e.g., SdkTspConfigValidation errors).\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this, you have two options:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Suppress SDK validation rules for emitters you do not support**: Add a suppressions.yaml file in your service folder and explicitly suppress the relevant SdkTspConfigValidation sub-rules for each SDK emitter you do not support (e.g., Go, Java, .NET, JS). Example:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  sub-rules:\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\\\\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\\\\n    # Add similar lines for other emitters as needed\\\\n  reason: 'No SDK required for private preview.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n2. **(Not recommended) Add minimal emitter options**: You could add placeholder emitter options for each required SDK emitter, but this is discouraged if you do not intend to generate SDKs.\\\\n\\\\n**Best Practice:** Use suppressions.yaml to bypass SDK validation for emitters not in scope. This is the recommended approach for private preview ARM APIs.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you are ready to onboard SDK generation (e.g., for public preview or GA), you should add the appropriate emitter options to tspconfig.yaml following the Azure SDK guidelines.\\\\n\\\\nSummary: API approval for private preview does NOT require SDK generation. Use suppressions.yaml to pass TypeSpec validation without SDK emitter configs.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"API approval for private preview does NOT always require SDK generation or SDK configuration in your tspconfig.yaml. For private preview ARM APIs, it is acceptable to onboard and validate your API contract without including SDK emitter settings (such as for Go, Python, Java, etc.).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the Azure TypeSpec validation tooling (tsv) is configured to expect certain SDK emitter options in tspconfig.yaml by default, even for private preview, which is why you see SdkTspConfigValidation failures if you remove them.\\\\n\\\\nThe correct and supported approach is:\\\\n- Remove SDK emitter configs you do NOT want in your tspconfig.yaml.\\\\n- Add a suppressions.yaml file in the same directory as tspconfig.yaml to explicitly suppress the SdkTspConfigValidation rule (or specific sub-rules for missing SDK configs).\\\\n\\\\nHere is a sample suppressions.yaml to suppress all SdkTspConfigValidation checks (recommended for your scenario):\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\\\n  paths:\\\\n    - tspconfig.yaml\\\\n  rules:\\\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\\\n  reason: 'SDK generation is not in scope for private preview onboarding.'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlace this suppressions.yaml alongside your tspconfig.yaml. This will allow CI and local validation to succeed without requiring SDK settings, letting you focus on API review and onboarding. When you later want to add SDK support, you can remove the suppression and add the required SDK emitter configuration.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary: No, API approval for private preview does not require SDK generation.

            "answer": "Your TypeSpec validation is failing because the validation pipeline is enforcing the presence of Go SDK emitter configuration options in your `tspconfig.yaml`, even though your service does not require a Go SDK. This is due to the `SdkTspConfigValidation` rule, which checks for required emitter options for all supported SDK languages.\n\nSince you do not plan to support a Go SDK for your service, the correct and supported approach is to suppress the specific Go-related validation sub-rules. You should not add dummy or placeholder Go configuration options if you are not generating a Go SDK.\n\nTo resolve this, add a `suppressions.yaml` file (or update your existing one) at the root of your service specification folder with the following content:\n\n```yaml\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\n  paths:\n    - tspconfig.yaml\n  rules:\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\n  sub-rules:\n    # Suppress validation for Go emitter options\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.generate-fakes\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.inject-spans\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.service-dir\n    - options.@azure-tools/typespec-go.package-dir\n  reason: 'This service does not support a Go SDK currently.'\n```\n\nThis will suppress only the Go-specific configuration checks and allow your PR to pass TypeSpec validation, while remaining compliant with Azure API guidelines. Make sure to commit this file with your PR.\n\nIf you later decide to support a Go SDK, you must remove these suppressions and add the required Go emitter options to your `tspconfig.yaml`.",

CLI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nParameters can be organized in a nested structure, to access different levels of the structure, use dots (`.`) in the variable expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTherefore, parameter names should not contain `.` in their name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be utilized in the default value of these parameters.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese parameters can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll parameters must have a default

using a specific rule designed to collapse a path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a variable is succeeded by a `/` or `.` and the emitter responsible for interpolating the config doesn't supply that variable, the path segment will be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, consider the following config value: `{service-name}/output.{version}.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's what would be produced:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Service name value | Version value | Result                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n|

            "answer": "You should NOT use @OpenAPI.extension(\"x-ms-identifiers\", #[]) in your Azure Resource Manager TypeSpec code. The no-openapi rule is strict: ARM specs must NOT use decorators from @typespec/openapi or @azure-tools/typespec-autorest, including $extension, because these are only processed by OpenAPI emitters and will break other emitters (like client SDKs).\nFor array properties, the correct approach is to use the @identifiers decorator from @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager. This decorator is the ARM-compliant way to specify identifying properties for array items and will ensure that x-ms-identifiers is emitted in the generated OpenAPI as needed, without violating the no-openapi rule. If there are no identifying properties, you can use @identifiers([]) to indicate this.\nExample:\n```\n@identifiers([])\nmyArrayField: MyItemType[];\n```\nIf you use @identifiers, the ARM linter will recognize the array is correctly specified and will not require you to use the OpenAPI extension directly.\nYou should only suppress the error if you have a legitimate, ARM-approved reason (for example, for backwards compatibility or an explicit reviewer exemption). But for new fields and normal scenarios, always use the ARM-compliant decorators, NOT OpenAPI extensions.\nSummary:\nDO NOT use @OpenAPI.extension(\"x-ms-identifiers\", #[]) in ARM specs.\nDO use @identifiers([]) or @identifiers([\"propertyName\"]) as appropriate for array items.\nSuppression should only be used in rare, reviewer-approved cases, not as a general workaround.\nThis approach ensures your spec is future-proof, passes all ARM validation, and is compliant with Azure API guidelines.",

The use of OpenAPI decorators is explicitly forbidden by the Azure API guidelines, as these decorators are only interpreted by the OpenAPI emitter and break compatibility with other emitters and tooling. Instead, you must use the @identifiers decorator from the Azure Resource Manager TypeSpec library to specify identifying properties for array items. For example:\n\n```typespec\nmodel ResourceProperties {\n  @identifiers(#[])\n  array: Address[];\n}\n```\n\nIf there are no identifying properties, you should pass an empty array to @identifiers. This will satisfy the missing-x-ms-identifiers rule and avoid the no-openapi error. Do NOT suppress these errors unless you have a documented, reviewed justification and have discussed with your ARM reviewer. The correct, permanent fix is to use @identifiers, not @OpenAPI.extension.\n\nIf you are using an older TypeSpec version or emitter that does not support @identifiers, you should update your TypeSpec packages to the latest versions as specified in the azure-rest-api-specs repo. This will ensure that your spec is compliant and future-proof.\n\nSummary:\n- Use @identifiers, NOT @OpenAPI.extension(\"x-ms-identifiers\", ...)\n- Do NOT suppress unless absolutely necessary and reviewed\n- Update your TypeSpec packages if needed\n\nThis approach resolves both errors according to Azure guidelines and ensures your spec is valid for all emitters.",

The use of OpenAPI decorators is explicitly forbidden by the Azure API guidelines, as these decorators are only interpreted by the OpenAPI emitter and break compatibility with other emitters and tooling. Instead, you must use the @identifiers decorator from the Azure Resource Manager TypeSpec library to specify identifying properties for array items. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nmodel ResourceProperties {\\\\n  @identifiers(#[])\\\\n  array: Address[];\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf there are no identifying properties, you should pass an empty array to @identifiers.

This decorator is the ARM-compliant way to specify identifying properties for array items and will ensure that x-ms-identifiers is emitted in the generated OpenAPI as needed, without violating the no-openapi rule. If there are no identifying properties, you can use @identifiers([]) to indicate this.\\\\nExample:\\\\n```\\\\n@identifiers([])\\\\nmyArrayField: MyItemType[];\\\\n```\\\\nIf you use @identifiers, the ARM linter will recognize the array is correctly specified and will not require you to use the OpenAPI extension directly.\\\\nYou should only suppress the error if you have a legitimate, ARM-approved reason (for example, for backwards compatibility or an explicit reviewer exemption). But for new fields and normal scenarios, always use the ARM-compliant decorators, NOT OpenAPI extensions.\\\\nSummary:\\\\nDO NOT use @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\", #[]) in ARM specs.\\\\nDO use @identifiers([]) or @identifiers([\\\\\\\"propertyName\\\\\\\"]) as appropriate for array items.\\\\nSuppression should only be used in rare, reviewer-approved cases, not as a general workaround.\\\\nThis approach ensures your spec is future-proof, passes all ARM validation, and is compliant with Azure API guidelines.\\\"}\"}]",

However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"troubleshoot#suppresswarnings.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"How to suppress warnings\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/troubleshoot/suppresswarnings\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# How to suppress warnings\\\\\\\\n## Workaround\\\\\\\\n# troubleshoot#suppresswarnings.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How to suppress warnings\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Workaround\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome of the rules after review can be suppressed to get clean compile outputs using `#suppress ErrCode ReasonMsg` statement.

Create or update the TypeSpec files for your service.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3. Add or update 'examples' files for each operation of your OpenAPI file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   The [oav](https://github.com/Azure/oav) provides two ways to generate OpenAPI examples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   1. Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set. Since the auto-generated\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     examples consist of random values for most types, you need replace them with meaningful values.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       oav generate-examples openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n       \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Note, latest OAV tool should automatically generate the following. However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     please ensure you have:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `operationId`.

However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n

supported, thanks!\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSomething like:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@example({\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"exampleScheduledAction\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  summary: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Example of a scheduled action resource\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  value:

Instead, the typespec-autorest emitter automatically matches and inserts examples by operationId, see: x-ms-examples example files | TypeSpec Azure\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding how to control the values that will be generated in the examples. This is really an oav question, so notreally an expert, but I know there is a mechanism for con figuring examples, but you can find some details here: [Azure/oav: Tools for validating OpenAPI (Swagger) files](https://github.com/Azure/oav?tab=readme-ov-file#what-does-the-tool-do-what-issues-does-the-tool-catch). \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can also update values after the examples are generated.  There is also the api scenario mechanism which provides a bit more configurable example generation as part of servic eapi testing: [azure-rest-api-specs/documentation/api-scenario at main \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/documentation/api-scenario)\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"libraries#typespec-client-generator-core#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/decorators\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Decorators\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ClientGenerator.Core\\\\\\\\n### `@alternateType` {#@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.alternateType}\\\\\\\\n# libraries#typespec-client-generator-core#reference#decorators.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Azure.ClientGenerator.Core\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `@alternateType` {#@Azure.ClientGenerator.Core.alternateType}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| alternate | `unknown \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\| ClientGenerator.Core.ExternalType` | The alternate type to apply to the target.

            "answer": "You should NOT manually edit the autogenerated hardware.json file to work around TypeSpec or linter errors. Instead, you must address these issues at the TypeSpec source level and via configuration, following Azure TypeSpec best practices.\n1.ProvisioningState Must Be ReadOnly: The LintDiff check for `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` is triggered because the validation expects the type schema referenced by `provisioningState` to be `readOnly`, not just the property instance. The recommended (and officially supported) solution is to update your `tspconfig.yaml` to set:\n```\noptions:\n\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\":\nuse-read-only-status-schema: true\n```\nThis ensures all `ProvisioningState` schemas are emitted as `readOnly`, resolving the LintDiff error at the TypeSpec emission layer and removing the need to edit the generated Swagger.\n2.Missing Examples for Subscription-level APIs: The OpenAPI validation (ModelValidation) requires an example for each operation, including subscription-level (preview) APIs. If auto-generation tools like OAV are not generating examples for these, you must:\nManually add a valid example JSON file in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder of your TypeSpec project, ensuring the `operationId` matches your operation.\nThere is currently NO supported way to suppress example requirements in TypeSpec or Swagger for missing examples. Suppression can sometimes be done via labels (like `Approved-ModelValidation`) to unblock a PR, but the recommended approach is to provide at least one example per operation.\nGeneral Best Practices:\nDo NOT edit the emitted Swagger (`hardware.json`). Always make changes at the TypeSpec or configuration level.\nIf you encounter TypeSpec validation failures, refer to the TypeSpec source, emitter options, or required supporting files (such as examples or suppressions.yaml for certain rule types). For LintDiff, suppressions must be done in `readme.md` or `suppressions.yaml` (for TypeSpecRequirement errors only, not LintDiff or example requirements).\nSummary:\nSet `use-read-only-status-schema: true` in `tspconfig.yaml` to resolve the `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` error.\nAdd missing example files for all operations, including subscription-level ones, as there is no suppression for missing examples.\nNever edit the generated OpenAPI files to workaround linter errors.\nLet me know if you need guidance on creating an example file or configuring the emitter options.",

            "answer": "You should not manually edit the autogenerated OpenAPI (hardware.json) to resolve validation errors. All changes to the OpenAPI must be made in the TypeSpec source and then regenerated using `tsp compile` to ensure consistency and compliance with Azure API guidelines. \n\nFor the `provisioningState` property:\n- In TypeSpec, you should mark the property as read-only using the `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` decorator on the property itself, not on the model/type. TypeSpec does not support marking an entire model as read-only\u2014only properties can be decorated this way. For example:\n\n```typespec\nmodel Hardware {\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\n  provisioningState: string;\n  // other properties\n}\n```\nThis will ensure the generated OpenAPI marks `provisioningState` as `readOnly: true`.\n\nFor the missing example on a subscription-level Preview API:\n- Examples must be provided as separate JSON files in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder within your TypeSpec directory. These examples are linked to operations via the `operationId` field in the example file. You should not manually add examples to the OpenAPI file. Instead, generate them using the `oav generate-examples` tool, then edit the generated example files to provide meaningful values. If the tool does not generate examples for subscription-level APIs, you can manually create the example JSON file, ensuring it includes the correct `operationId` and `title` fields.\n\nSuppression of TypeSpec Validation errors:\n- TypeSpec Validation errors (such as mismatches between TypeSpec and OpenAPI, or missing required decorators/options) cannot be suppressed for PRs. You must resolve these errors in the TypeSpec source. Only certain sub-rules (like emitter options for SDKs you do not support) can be suppressed via `suppressions.yaml`, but not core validation errors about resource shape or required examples.\n\nSummary:\n- Do not manually edit OpenAPI files. Make all changes in TypeSpec and regenerate.\n- Use `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` for read-only properties.\n- Provide examples as separate JSON files linked by `operationId`.\n- Suppression is not allowed for core TypeSpec Validation errors\u2014fix them in TypeSpec.\n\nIf you continue to have issues, ensure your local environment is up to date (`git pull`, `npm ci`) and run `npx tsp compile` and `npx tsv <spec-path>` to validate locally before updating your PR.",

Currently there is one failure related to hardware.json (autogenerated OpenAPI file) having been modified. But the changes to hardware.json are to prevent other linter errors. The change to add readOnly to provisioningState was needed, as without it the Swagger LintDiff check failed asking to make it readOnly, and these changes were suggested by the representative in the ARM Office hours to work around the error. The other change in hardware.json is to add example for Preview API, which is subscription level API. the example markup was not getting auto-generated in the swagger json, so it needed to be added manually to prevent another swagger check of missing example from failing. Need some guidance to work around these errors.\\\\nFor these specific errors, not sure if there is a way to mark example files for subscription level API or suppress errors for these APIs, and also, any way to mark provisioningState readOnly in tsp file (note, the instance was already marked as readOnly, but the error is around marking the type as readOnly.\\\\nThanks!\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"You should not manually edit the autogenerated OpenAPI (hardware.json) to resolve validation errors. All changes to the OpenAPI must be made in the TypeSpec source and then regenerated using `tsp compile` to ensure consistency and compliance with Azure API guidelines. \\\\n\\\\nFor the `provisioningState` property:\\\\n- In TypeSpec, you should mark the property as read-only using the `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` decorator on the property itself, not on the model/type. TypeSpec does not support marking an entire model as read-only\\\\u2014only properties can be decorated this way. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nmodel Hardware {\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\n  provisioningState: string;\\\\n  // other properties\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis will ensure the generated OpenAPI marks `provisioningState` as `readOnly: true`.\\\\n\\\\nFor the missing example on a subscription-level Preview API:\\\\n- Examples must be provided as separate JSON files in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder within your TypeSpec directory. These examples are linked to operations via the `operationId` field in the example file. You should not manually add examples to the OpenAPI file. Instead, generate them using the `oav generate-examples` tool, then edit the generated example files to provide meaningful values. If the tool does not generate examples for subscription-level APIs, you can manually create the example JSON file, ensuring it includes the correct `operationId` and `title` fields.\\\\n\\\\nSuppression of TypeSpec Validation errors:\\\\n- TypeSpec Validation errors (such as mismatches between TypeSpec and OpenAPI, or missing required decorators/options) cannot be suppressed for PRs. You must resolve these errors in the TypeSpec source. Only certain sub-rules (like emitter options for SDKs you do not support) can be suppressed via `suppressions.yaml`, but not core validation errors about resource shape or required examples.\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\n- Do not manually edit OpenAPI files.

Instead, you must address these issues at the TypeSpec source level and via configuration, following Azure TypeSpec best practices.\\\\n1.ProvisioningState Must Be ReadOnly: The LintDiff check for `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` is triggered because the validation expects the type schema referenced by `provisioningState` to be `readOnly`, not just the property instance. The recommended (and officially supported) solution is to update your `tspconfig.yaml` to set:\\\\n```\\\\noptions:\\\\n\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\":\\\\nuse-read-only-status-schema: true\\\\n```\\\\nThis ensures all `ProvisioningState` schemas are emitted as `readOnly`, resolving the LintDiff error at the TypeSpec emission layer and removing the need to edit the generated Swagger.\\\\n2.Missing Examples for Subscription-level APIs: The OpenAPI validation (ModelValidation) requires an example for each operation, including subscription-level (preview) APIs. If auto-generation tools like OAV are not generating examples for these, you must:\\\\nManually add a valid example JSON file in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder of your TypeSpec project, ensuring the `operationId` matches your operation.\\\\nThere is currently NO supported way to suppress example requirements in TypeSpec or Swagger for missing examples. Suppression can sometimes be done via labels (like `Approved-ModelValidation`) to unblock a PR, but the recommended approach is to provide at least one example per operation.\\\\nGeneral Best Practices:\\\\nDo NOT edit the emitted Swagger (`hardware.json`). Always make changes at the TypeSpec or configuration level.\\\\nIf you encounter TypeSpec validation failures, refer to the TypeSpec source, emitter options, or required supporting files (such as examples or suppressions.yaml for certain rule types). For LintDiff, suppressions must be done in `readme.md` or `suppressions.yaml` (for TypeSpecRequirement errors only, not LintDiff or example requirements).\\\\nSummary:\\\\nSet `use-read-only-status-schema: true` in `tspconfig.yaml` to resolve the `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` error.\\\\nAdd missing example files for all operations, including subscription-level ones, as there is no suppression for missing examples.\\\\nNever edit the generated OpenAPI files to workaround linter errors.\\\\nLet me know if you need guidance on creating an example file or configuring the emitter options.\\\"}\"}]",

TypeSpec encodes many fo these rules into linting checks that occur on each compilation. If you use an IDE and install the [TypeSpec IDE Tools](../../getstarted/azure-resource-manager/step00.md#installing-ide-tools), violations of rules will show up as yellow highlights in your tsp code. If you hover over these, you will get a message indicating the issue and how to fix it in your specification. If you use the typespec command-line, violations of rules will be printed as warnings, with a description and steps to correct the issue, and a pointer to the location in the specification where the violation occurred.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the sections below, we will discuss these rules, how they work, and, in cases where a violation is a false positive, or has a reason approved by an ARM reviewer, can be suppressed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## ARM RPC Rules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec has a set of linting rules that execute whenever the specification is compiled, and in the IDE as you type. Violations are highlighted inline in the spec, or emitted during compilation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor more information, see [ARM RPC rules](https://eng.ms/docs/products/arm/api_contracts/guidelines/rpc)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Detecting and Suppressing Rule Violations at Design Time\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nViolations of ARM RPC rules will show up at design time as a yellow highlight over the violating type in TypeSpec, and at compile time as an emitted warning with a specific reference in the specification code (line number, position, pointer).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is an example of a linter warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDiagnostics were reported during compilation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nC:/typespec-samples/resource-manager/zerotrust/main.tsp:38:3 - warning @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager/arm-resource-operation-missing-decorator: Resource POST operation must be decorated with @armResourceAction.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e 38 |   /** Gets the Zero Trust URL for this resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e 39 |   @post\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     | ^^^^^^^\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e 40 |   getZeroTrustUrl(...ResourceInstanceParameters\\\\\\\\u003cZeroTrustResource\\\\\\\\u003e): ZeroTrustUrl | ErrorResponse;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFound 1 warning.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo suppress the warning, you would use the `#suppress` directive on the type that violates the rule.

Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set.

However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n     please ensure you have:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - include `operationId`. This is used to match with declared operations in TypeSpec and correctly output in OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n4. Add/update the `readme.md` file in the `{service}` folder to specify the version and location of the OpenAPI files. The `readme.md` is needed for both management-plane and data-plane services for REST API Docs generation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   Example:[sample-readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/widget/resource-manager/Microsoft.Widget/Widget/readme.md)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n5.

Starting in Q4FY26, PRs for new API versions that are not based on TypeSpec will be blocked. SDK releases from non-TypeSpec specs will be blocked as well. The requirement to move to TypeSpec Azure will ensure a consistent, high-quality developer experience across\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e Azure that aligns with Azure SDK guidelines. For more information on TypeSpec Azure, visit [here](xref:api-typespec).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) is the new standard API definition language for Azure, developed by Microsoft. It is an open-source tool designed to generate OpenAPI specifications and other API description languages. TypeSpec can also produce client code, with service code generation in progress. TypeSpec offers highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST patterns used for Azure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Benefits of TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Consistency across APIs**: TypeSpec ensures consistency across APIs by using high-level templates, reducing the need for repetitive tasks and minimizing errors. This uniform design approach acts as a single source of truth for API definitions, enhancing both consistency and quality.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency and speed**: TypeSpec significantly reduces the amount of code needed to define API specifications. A ten-line code snippet in TypeSpec can generate a hundred lines of an OpenAPI specification, drastically reducing manual effort.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Enhanced tooling**: TypeSpec comes with advanced tools that catch errors early, leading to more robust APIs. Additionally, extensions for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespecvs) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespec-vscode) aid in efficient TypeSpec creation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Accessibility**: The compact nature of TypeSpec, combined with its familiar JavaScript-style syntax, allows even non-technical stakeholders to participate in the API review and design process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Case Studies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHear directly from teams who have successfully transitioned to TypeSpec Azure and learn about their experiences:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Azure Batch\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EUkgwSc69lpPsBjQBfLfMEgB0WCTBe9x7ozU8VNK2s8mAw?e=1MIXZi)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There's definitions in Swagger, but \\\\u2026 TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice. The VS code integration right out of the box is something I've really liked.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### MS Learn\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EXjQ3t7i-z9BpxVUgZVcS6QBxjLYdRLUquX2y8xczNxfbA?e=nesl3Q)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\u201cOne of the highlights [of using TypeSpec] was our ability to author API specs in a very simple and intuitive language. This meant that even [our PMs] who are not engineers were able to understand these API specifications. They could review them, make comments, and participate in designing those APIs.\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Azure AI Content Safety\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EdlE2PYtZ9BKoXQ-R0h-O10B9RidePBT4mwB1JgIqRC01A?e=JRneI2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I find TypeSpec to be much simpler to learn and write compared to Swagger. In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether you're working with Data Plane (DP) or Azure Resource Manager (ARM), having clear examples to follow can make your transition to TypeSpec smoother. Here are some resources that can help:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Playground Examples**: Our playground provides ARM and DP examples that serve as excellent models for teams new to TypeSpec Azure. These examples are concise and take full advantage of our standard operation templates. You can use these as a gold standard for your own TypeSpec definitions. Visit the [TypeSpec Azure Playground](https://aka.ms/trytypespec/azure) to explore these examples.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **ARM Samples**: For more specific scenarios, check out our additional [ARM samples](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/tree/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/arm-scenarios). These are tutorial-like examples that cover various scenarios. You can adapt these to fit your specific needs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe playground examples are a great starting point for getting familiar with TypeSpec Azure. As you gain more experience, you can leverage the ARM samples to understand how to apply TypeSpec to a variety of scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec office hours\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJoin us on Mondays from 4-5 PM PT for our TypeSpec office hours.

The ARM template schema is generated automatically from the OpenAPI JSON file in the public API spec repo, and the generated file does mark entityName as readOnly.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe issue seems to stem from how the schema generator interprets required and readOnly. Specifically, it assumes required applies only to writable views of the resource body, which leads to misleading IntelliSense warnings in Bicep. This is likely due to shared logic in the Bicep and schema generation code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOptionality in OpenAPI is context-dependent\\\\u2014relevant to either requests or responses\\\\u2014while in TypeSpec, optionality for resource types indicates whether a property is part of the resource conceptually. Nullability, on the other hand, means the property accepts null in requests, which is discouraged in Azure.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA proposed fix is already under discussion here: https://github.com/Azure/bicep-types-az/pull/2568.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Typespec Validation Failing on PR due to `typespec-go` configuration missing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCI has been failing constantly for our PR ([Azure Load Testing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Add 2025-03-01-preview Data-Plane APIs by Harshan01 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #32585 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/32585)) for Typespec Validation step.

If you do not need to continue supporting the older preview, you might consider removing it,  otherwise, this is an error you can safely suppress (https://aka.ms/ci-fix is a great link to remember, as it has links to all kinds of useful info about ci errors, including a link to the suppression guides).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor PrivateEndpointConnections, RPs have done both, as the name of the private endpoint connection type doesn't really matter to the API, however, there is a new template that greatly simplifies adding private endpoint connection operations to any resourc,e see: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[typespec-azure/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-end\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/blob/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/resource-types/private-endpoints/private-endpoints.tsp#L69-L94)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel PrivateEndpointConnection is PrivateEndpointConnectionResource;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nalias PrivateEndpointOperations = PrivateEndpoints\\\\\\\\u003cPrivateEndpointConnection\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Readonly on model\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Readonly on model\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_05_22.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Readonly on model\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe have such swagger\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ReadonlyOnModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  readonly: true,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties: {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n},\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AnotherModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  properties: {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      $ref: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ReadonlyOnModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the type of property \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in another model is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ReadonlyOnModel\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", M4 will give a readonly on that property \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

All changes to the OpenAPI must be made in the TypeSpec source and then regenerated using `tsp compile` to ensure consistency and compliance with Azure API guidelines. \\\\n\\\\nFor the `provisioningState` property:\\\\n- In TypeSpec, you should mark the property as read-only using the `@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)` decorator on the property itself, not on the model/type. TypeSpec does not support marking an entire model as read-only\\\\u2014only properties can be decorated this way. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nmodel Hardware {\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\n  provisioningState: string;\\\\n  // other properties\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis will ensure the generated OpenAPI marks `provisioningState` as `readOnly: true`.\\\\n\\\\nFor the missing example on a subscription-level Preview API:\\\\n- Examples must be provided as separate JSON files in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder within your TypeSpec directory. These examples are linked to operations via the `operationId` field in the example file. You should not manually add examples to the OpenAPI file. Instead, generate them using the `oav generate-examples` tool, then edit the generated example files to provide meaningful values. If the tool does not generate examples for subscription-level APIs, you can manually create the example JSON file, ensuring it includes the correct `operationId` and `title` fields.\\\\n\\\\nSuppression of TypeSpec Validation errors:\\\\n- TypeSpec Validation errors (such as mismatches between TypeSpec and OpenAPI, or missing required decorators/options) cannot be suppressed for PRs. You must resolve these errors in the TypeSpec source. Only certain sub-rules (like emitter options for SDKs you do not support) can be suppressed via `suppressions.yaml`, but not core validation errors about resource shape or required examples.\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\n- Do not manually edit OpenAPI files.

Instead, you must address these issues at the TypeSpec source level and via configuration, following Azure TypeSpec best practices.\\\\n1.ProvisioningState Must Be ReadOnly: The LintDiff check for `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` is triggered because the validation expects the type schema referenced by `provisioningState` to be `readOnly`, not just the property instance. The recommended (and officially supported) solution is to update your `tspconfig.yaml` to set:\\\\n```\\\\noptions:\\\\n\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\":\\\\nuse-read-only-status-schema: true\\\\n```\\\\nThis ensures all `ProvisioningState` schemas are emitted as `readOnly`, resolving the LintDiff error at the TypeSpec emission layer and removing the need to edit the generated Swagger.\\\\n2.Missing Examples for Subscription-level APIs: The OpenAPI validation (ModelValidation) requires an example for each operation, including subscription-level (preview) APIs. If auto-generation tools like OAV are not generating examples for these, you must:\\\\nManually add a valid example JSON file in the `examples/<api-version>/` folder of your TypeSpec project, ensuring the `operationId` matches your operation.\\\\nThere is currently NO supported way to suppress example requirements in TypeSpec or Swagger for missing examples. Suppression can sometimes be done via labels (like `Approved-ModelValidation`) to unblock a PR, but the recommended approach is to provide at least one example per operation.\\\\nGeneral Best Practices:\\\\nDo NOT edit the emitted Swagger (`hardware.json`). Always make changes at the TypeSpec or configuration level.\\\\nIf you encounter TypeSpec validation failures, refer to the TypeSpec source, emitter options, or required supporting files (such as examples or suppressions.yaml for certain rule types). For LintDiff, suppressions must be done in `readme.md` or `suppressions.yaml` (for TypeSpecRequirement errors only, not LintDiff or example requirements).\\\\nSummary:\\\\nSet `use-read-only-status-schema: true` in `tspconfig.yaml` to resolve the `ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly` error.\\\\nAdd missing example files for all operations, including subscription-level ones, as there is no suppression for missing examples.\\\\nNever edit the generated OpenAPI files to workaround linter errors.\\\\nLet me know if you need guidance on creating an example file or configuring the emitter options.\\\"}\"}]",

The suppression mechanism for LintDiff errors is documented here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff#adding-scoped-suppressions. \\\\n\\\\nTo suppress this error, add a directive to your readme.md under the 'directive' section, targeting the exact path of the error in your generated Swagger.

This will silence the LintDiff error for that specific model.

Specifically, patterns like {width}x{height} or {x}/{y}@{scale}x in your API paths are now breaking validation due to stricter parsing rules introduced in path-to-regexp@6.2.1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPreviously, your spec passed validation because older versions of path-to-regexp were more lenient. The recent update introduced security fixes that inadvertently caused this break.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo unblock your PR, we\\\\u2019ve deployed a temporary fix that pins path-to-regexp to an older version. This means your Swagger checks should no longer crash. Meanwhile, we\\\\u2019re working on a permanent solution that doesn\\\\u2019t rely on pinning old code.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you still need to validate locally, you can manually install the older version and run oav like this:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cinstall node 20\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmkdir testdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncd testdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnpm i oav path-to-regexp@6.2.2\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnpx oav validate-example /path/to/your/openapi.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, you can use validate-spec instead of validate-example if you're checking the spec directly. This workaround has been confirmed to pass for your PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ve also applied the approved-modelvalidation and approved-semanticvalidation labels to your PR to unblock progress. Just note that if other issues surface later due to this regression, you may need to address them in a follow-up PR.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_09_12.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Swagger LintDiff Suppression via TypeSpec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Swagger LintDiff Suppression via TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_09_12.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Swagger LintDiff Suppression via TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The storage type used for the Operating System disk of Dev Boxes created using this definition.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hibernateSupport\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"$ref\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#/definitions/HibernateSupport\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Indicates whether Dev Boxes created with this definition are capable of hibernation.

According to Azure API and TypeSpec guidelines, all resource models must include these properties to be compliant.\\\\nSuppressing this error is not the correct approach\\\\u2014instead, you must fix your TypeSpec definition. Ensure that resource models either extend the appropriate common-types resource base model (such as `Resource`, `ProxyResource`, or `ExtensionResource`) or, if `SharingDetail` is not a resource, ensure it is not referenced in a way that causes it to be treated as one.\\\\nFor suppressing LintDiff errors in general, you can add scoped suppressions in your `readme.md` following the guidance here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff#adding-scoped-suppressions.

            "answer": "To make an interface internal so that it does not appear in the public interface of the generated Python SDK, you should use the `@access(Access.internal, \"python\")` decorator from `@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core` on the interface itself. However, simply marking the interface or its operations as internal is not sufficient if any of its operations or models are referenced by public operations elsewhere in your TypeSpec. The access level propagates: if a model or operation is referenced by a public operation, it will be included in the public SDK interface regardless of its own access setting.\n\nFor your scenario:\n- Apply `@access(Access.internal, \"python\")` to the interface and all its operations.\n- Ensure that none of the operations or models from this interface are referenced by any public operations or models elsewhere in your TypeSpec. If they are, they will be promoted to public in the SDK.\n\nExample:\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\";\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\n\n@access(Access.internal, \"python\")\ninterface EvaluationResultsOperations {\n  @access(Access.internal, \"python\")\n  op getResults(): EvaluationResult[];\n}\n\nmodel EvaluationResult {\n  value: string;\n}\n```\n\nIf you follow this pattern and ensure no public references, the interface and its operations will be hidden from the public Python SDK client. If you still see it in the generated SDK, double-check for any public references or usage that might be causing it to be promoted to public.\n\nNote: There is no supported way to remove exported classes or interfaces using Python SDK customization files (such as `_patch.py`). The only supported approach is via TypeSpec decorators as described above.",

I tried adding `@access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` to those classes, but it didn\\\\u2019t work. Using `@removed` does remove the classes, but it removes them for all language SDKs, which isn\\\\u2019t what we want. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there a recommended approach to exclude certain classes from generation only in the Python SDK? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to remove specific classes only from the Python SDK in TypeSpec, using @access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") won\\\\u2019t work if the model is referenced by a public operation. To hide the model, you must also apply the decorator to the related operation that uses it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn your case, the operation analyzeConversations uses the base type AnalyzeConversationTask, and the model you want to remove\\\\u2014LuisParameters\\\\u2014is a subtype of AnalysisParameters, which is used by ConversationTaskParameters. Since LuisParameters is part of a discriminated model (TargetIntentResult), it cannot be hidden from the wire-level API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the Python SDK board has recommended removing these types and you agree, then yes\\\\u2014adding @removed(version) is the only way to exclude them across all SDKs. Since the C# SDK has already shipped with these types, you could remove them in a C# patch release or the next planned release.

I tried adding `@access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` to those classes, but it didn\\\\u2019t work. Using `@removed` does remove the classes, but it removes them for all language SDKs, which isn\\\\u2019t what we want. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there a recommended approach to exclude certain classes from generation only in the Python SDK? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to remove specific classes only from the Python SDK in TypeSpec, using @access(Access.internal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") won\\\\u2019t work if the model is referenced by a public operation. To hide the model, you must also apply the decorator to the related operation that uses it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn your case, the operation analyzeConversations uses the base type AnalyzeConversationTask, and the model you want to remove\\\\u2014LuisParameters\\\\u2014is a subtype of AnalysisParameters, which is used by ConversationTaskParameters. Since LuisParameters is part of a discriminated model (TargetIntentResult), it cannot be hidden from the wire-level API.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the Python SDK board has recommended removing these types and you agree, then yes\\\\u2014adding @removed(version) is the only way to exclude them across all SDKs. Since the C# SDK has already shipped with these types, you could remove them in a C# patch release or the next planned release. This approach is acceptable for Python, but you need to confirm with the .NET team.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, it\\\\u2019s not possible to remove exported classes using _patch.py customization in the Python SDK.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#generate-client-libraries#03client.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Clients\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/03client\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"#

However, simply marking the interface or its operations as internal is not sufficient if any of its operations or models are referenced by public operations elsewhere in your TypeSpec.

All imports are static and apply to the entire compilation context, regardless of version. To exclude a resource type or model from a new API version, you must use the versioning decorators provided by the @typespec/versioning library. Specifically, you should mark the types, models, or operations you want to remove with the @removed decorator for the new version. This ensures that those elements are omitted from the generated OpenAPI spec for that version, while remaining present in previous versions. If you are working with preview versions, Azure policy is to only have a single active preview version at a time, so you may also consider deleting the resource type file if it is no longer needed.

on typeSpec to add a new preview with some new parameters and a new stable for all other properties that we already have? We have some properties that we don't want to include in a stable release just yet, but don't want that to hold us from releasing the other properties in a stable release.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCan we have multiple versions marked with @previewVersion? How do we handle a property that is in multiple preview versions, but we want to keep out of stable versions? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor a practical example, we have the faultSimulation apis in our spec in 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview. If I mark 2025-07-01-preview with @previewVersion and faultSimulation with @added(versions.v2025_07_01_preview), the generation removes it from the previous preview specs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLlBIPHLFByb2ZpbNR5cmVtb3bce%2FQAm%2FABm8UoZW5jb2RlKCJiYXNlNjR1cmwixBdwxno%2FOiBieXRlc%2BkAklRoZSBzdGF0dXPkAJV0aGUgbGFzdCDkAS9hdGlvbuUE4CAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAkphZMddxCDlBW9TdGF0xGflAhXMFOkBssRzzDLlAIDlARRh6QI%2FxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQDHNFU5QHO5gFk6QNcxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QaJ6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBuHHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QRn6QPh5AMh6QHK6QPjTW92ZVLHFegD3MRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA5rLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBPXmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AgAT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYIwi7LKXt9CuUInsgjyhvLWegAzeYFHWdldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFeiDnAntPcuUCp%2BUB1ssvQ8cdUmVwbGFjZUFzeW5jzj%2FlAvfIN0N1c3RvbVBhdGNoU8QqCiAgIOkAkyzFDvYA50ZvdW7kAybkBQ7IHOYAkU3kAYTGSdBLyhDqBhTFGT4KICDlAJ3mAprvANTlApdlV2l0aG91dE9r8wDUbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3JpcOUCecY7xjPMGcw56AbKIHNhbXBs6wNmYWPFRHRoYXTmAmPpBm10byBkaWZmZeQAhO8C5sUp7gCyQcVI5QGWyHcs7ANxyA3mAujzAJJIRUFE6gZMxH5jaGVja%2BoAqmV4aXN0ZW7mCDAgxh5FyRTvAljNHe4ICw%3D%3D\\\\\\\\u0026e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest\\\\\\\\u0026vs=%7B%7D) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2021-10-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2024-10-01 version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2024-10-01`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2024-10-01`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Age of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age?: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** City of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Profile of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-07-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @encode(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"base64url\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  profile?: bytes;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The status of the last operation. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningState?: ProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nshowing two propertties (EmployeeProperties.age and EmployeeProperties.profile) that use versioning.

When compiling a TypeSpec file, you specify the path to your root TypeSpec file, typically named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". From this root file, any imported files are added to your program. If a directory is imported, TypeSpec will search for a `main.tsp` file within that directory.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe path specified in the import must either start with `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` or `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`, or be an absolute path. The path should either point to a directory, or have an extension of either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".js\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

Starting in Q4FY26, PRs for new API versions that are not based on TypeSpec will be blocked. SDK releases from non-TypeSpec specs will be blocked as well. The requirement to move to TypeSpec Azure will ensure a consistent, high-quality developer experience across\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e Azure that aligns with Azure SDK guidelines. For more information on TypeSpec Azure, visit [here](xref:api-typespec).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) is the new standard API definition language for Azure, developed by Microsoft. It is an open-source tool designed to generate OpenAPI specifications and other API description languages. TypeSpec can also produce client code, with service code generation in progress. TypeSpec offers highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST patterns used for Azure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Benefits of TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Consistency across APIs**: TypeSpec ensures consistency across APIs by using high-level templates, reducing the need for repetitive tasks and minimizing errors. This uniform design approach acts as a single source of truth for API definitions, enhancing both consistency and quality.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency and speed**: TypeSpec significantly reduces the amount of code needed to define API specifications. A ten-line code snippet in TypeSpec can generate a hundred lines of an OpenAPI specification, drastically reducing manual effort.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Enhanced tooling**: TypeSpec comes with advanced tools that catch errors early, leading to more robust APIs. Additionally, extensions for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespecvs) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespec-vscode) aid in efficient TypeSpec creation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Accessibility**: The compact nature of TypeSpec, combined with its familiar JavaScript-style syntax, allows even non-technical stakeholders to participate in the API review and design process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Case Studies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHear directly from teams who have successfully transitioned to TypeSpec Azure and learn about their experiences:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Azure Batch\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EUkgwSc69lpPsBjQBfLfMEgB0WCTBe9x7ozU8VNK2s8mAw?e=1MIXZi)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There's definitions in Swagger, but \\\\u2026 TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice. The VS code integration right out of the box is something I've really liked.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### MS Learn\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EXjQ3t7i-z9BpxVUgZVcS6QBxjLYdRLUquX2y8xczNxfbA?e=nesl3Q)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\u201cOne of the highlights [of using TypeSpec] was our ability to author API specs in a very simple and intuitive language. This meant that even [our PMs] who are not engineers were able to understand these API specifications. They could review them, make comments, and participate in designing those APIs.\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Azure AI Content Safety\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EdlE2PYtZ9BKoXQ-R0h-O10B9RidePBT4mwB1JgIqRC01A?e=JRneI2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I find TypeSpec to be much simpler to learn and write compared to Swagger. In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether you're working with Data Plane (DP) or Azure Resource Manager (ARM), having clear examples to follow can make your transition to TypeSpec smoother. Here are some resources that can help:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Playground Examples**: Our playground provides ARM and DP examples that serve as excellent models for teams new to TypeSpec Azure. These examples are concise and take full advantage of our standard operation templates. You can use these as a gold standard for your own TypeSpec definitions. Visit the [TypeSpec Azure Playground](https://aka.ms/trytypespec/azure) to explore these examples.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **ARM Samples**: For more specific scenarios, check out our additional [ARM samples](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/tree/main/packages/samples/specs/resource-manager/arm-scenarios). These are tutorial-like examples that cover various scenarios. You can adapt these to fit your specific needs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe playground examples are a great starting point for getting familiar with TypeSpec Azure.

Services\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor ARM services, use the following file structure:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **main.tsp**: Entry point for the TypeSpec specification containing service information\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **{resource-name}.tsp**: Resource-specific operations for each ARM resource type\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **routes.tsp**: All other operations that don't belong to specific resources\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **models.tsp**: All the model definitions used across operations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **(optional) client.tsp**: Client-specific customizations and configurations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **(optional) back-compatible.tsp**: Backward compatibility definitions and legacy support\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis structure helps maintain a clear separation of concerns between the API description and the client SDK and makes the TypeSpec specification easier to navigate and maintain.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"#

developers to understand differences between versions, and simplifies maintenance by allowing independent updates to each version's specifications.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBy encapsulating different versions of the API within the context of the same TypeSpec project, we can manage all versions in a unified manner. This approach makes it easier to maintain consistency, apply updates, and ensure that all versions are properly documented and aligned with the overall API strategy.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"#

However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n

Step 2: Adding TypeSpec types to your library\\\\\\\\n# extending-typespec#basics.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Creating a TypeSpec Library\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Step 2: Adding TypeSpec types to your library\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOpen `./lib/main.tsp` and add any types you want to be available when users import this library. It's strongly recommended to put these types in a namespace that corresponds with the library name. For example, your `./lib/main.tsp` file might look like:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../dist/index.js\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace MyLibrary;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Person {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age: uint8;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Release new api version process with TypeSpec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Release new api version process with TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Release new api version process with TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi folks, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDo you have any process or script to execute when creating a new api version with TypeSpec which is similar to current [Copy-ApiVersion.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/eng/scripts/Copy-ApiVersion.ps1) script with API Spec?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs within the TypeSpec, those examples needs to be added manually and change the api version in it. I wonder if there are any existing script for doing this. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSPec, this is much simpler.  You don't need to replicate your old APIs, you just encode the changes in the api and tag them with decorators from the versioning library, as discussed here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning/) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will need to copy the example files from the example directory from the last version into a new example directory for the new version, and add any new examples. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask questions here, or come to our office hours on Monday.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"or specific areas\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/configuration/configuration\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# or specific areas\\\\\\\\n### `imports` - Configure additional imports\\\\\\\\n# handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# or specific areas\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### `imports` - Configure additional imports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimports:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - sidecar.tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSpecify additional TypeSpec files to import\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntsp compile . --import \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sidecar.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getstarted#azure-core#step09.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"9.

Here's an example of adding a new property to `Widget` and removing an old one:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A widget. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@resource(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"widgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The widget name. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"widgetName\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The widget color. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions.v2022_11_30)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  color: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The ID of the widget's manufacturer. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions.v2022_11_30)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  manufacturerId: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e You can do a lot more with versioning decorators, so consult the `typespec-versioning` [README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/packages/versioning#enable-versioning-for-service-or-library) for more information on how you can use them to annotate your service and describe changes between different versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is inevitable that service specifications will change over time. It is a best practice to add versioning support to your specification from the first version. To do that, you will need to define an `enum` containing your service versions and then apply the `@versioned` decorator to your service namespace.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is an example for the `WidgetManager` service:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things to point out here:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We define an `enum` called `Versions` inside of the service namespace. For each service version, we map a version symbol like `v2022_08_31` to a version string like `2022-08-31`. This service currently only has a single version, but we can add more to this enum as things change over time.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We add the `@versioned` decorator and reference the `Versions` enum we defined using the fully-qualified name `Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions`. This marks the service as being versioned and specifies the set of versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We change the `@useDependency` decorator we used previously to now link each service version to a specific version of `Azure.Core`. See the [Using Azure.Core Versions](#using-azurecore-versions) section for more information.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nImagine that it's 3 months later and you want to release a new version of your service with some slight changes. Add a new version to the `Versions` enum:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-11-30\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will also need to add the `@useDependency` decorator:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-11-30\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, you can express changes to your service using the `@added` and `@removed` decorators.

When compiling a TypeSpec file, you specify the path to your root TypeSpec file, typically named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". From this root file, any imported files are added to your program. If a directory is imported, TypeSpec will search for a `main.tsp` file within that directory.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe path specified in the import must either start with `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` or `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`, or be an absolute path. The path should either point to a directory, or have an extension of either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".js\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

Documentation-only changes are not considered breaking changes in Azure TypeSpec projects, and they do not trigger SDK releases or require version-specific handling. If TypeSpec validation fails due to documentation changes not being present in older specs, you should simply update those older specs with the improved descriptions. There is no need to change the output path in tspconfig.yaml to only generate the current version; doing so would not be compliant with Azure API versioning guidelines and would reduce reproducibility and traceability across versions. Instead, keep generating all versions and ensure documentation improvements are reflected everywhere. Any CI checks that flag documentation-only changes as breaking can be safely approved, as these do not impact wire shape or client compatibility.",

However, you must ensure that the new operation signature is actually different\u2014typically by adding a new parameter model for the filter, and using the `Parameters` template argument of `ArmListBySubscription`.\n\nHere's the recommended approach:\n\n1. **Define a parameters model for the filter** (and any other query parameters you want to support):\n\n```typespec\nmodel OfferingListParameters {\n  @query(\"filter\")\n  filter?: string;\n  // Add other query parameters as needed\n}\n```\n\n2. **Version the operation using @removed and @added decorators**. The new operation should use the `Parameters` argument:\n\n```typespec\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Offerings {\n  // Old operation (no filter)\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering>;\n\n  // New operation (with filter)\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering, Parameters = OfferingListParameters>;\n}\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- The operation name (`listBySubscription`) can stay the same if you use @removed/@added to version the signature. The TypeSpec compiler will emit the correct operation for each version.\n- If you want to keep both operations for some reason, you can use different names (e.g., `listBySubscriptionV2`), but the standard pattern is to keep the name and version the signature.\n- Make sure your `Versions` enum is up to date and referenced correctly.\n- The filter parameter should be optional unless you want to require it for all requests.\n\n**Why your previous attempts failed:**\n- If you use the same operation signature for both @removed and @added, TypeSpec sees no difference and may not emit the correct versioned API. You must change the operation signature (by adding the parameters model) for the new version.\n\n**Example:**\n```typespec\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Offerings {\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering>;\n\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering, Parameters = OfferingListParameters>;\n}\n```\nThis will generate the correct OpenAPI for each version: the old version without filter, and the new version with filter support.\n\nIf you need to support more query parameters, you can extend `OfferingListParameters` or use intersection types as shown in the references.",

The new operation should use the `Parameters` argument:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Offerings {\\\\n  // Old operation (no filter)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering>;\\\\n\\\\n  // New operation (with filter)\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering, Parameters = OfferingListParameters>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Key points:**\\\\n- The operation name (`listBySubscription`) can stay the same if you use @removed/@added to version the signature. The TypeSpec compiler will emit the correct operation for each version.\\\\n- If you want to keep both operations for some reason, you can use different names (e.g., `listBySubscriptionV2`), but the standard pattern is to keep the name and version the signature.\\\\n- Make sure your `Versions` enum is up to date and referenced correctly.\\\\n- The filter parameter should be optional unless you want to require it for all requests.\\\\n\\\\n**Why your previous attempts failed:**\\\\n- If you use the same operation signature for both @removed and @added, TypeSpec sees no difference and may not emit the correct versioned API. You must change the operation signature (by adding the parameters model) for the new version.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Offerings {\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering>;\\\\n\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering, Parameters = OfferingListParameters>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis will generate the correct OpenAPI for each version: the old version without filter, and the new version with filter support.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to support more query parameters, you can extend `OfferingListParameters` or use intersection types as shown in the references.\\\", \\\"context\\\": \\\"[{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#arm#resource-operations.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ARM Resource Operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/resource-operations\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# ARM Resource Operations\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec Operation Templates and Interface Templates\\\\\\\\n### Resource List Operations (GET)\\\\\\\\n# howtos#arm#resource-operations.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# ARM Resource Operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## TypeSpec Operation Templates and Interface Templates\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Resource List Operations (GET)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArm Resource list operations return a list of Tracked or Proxy Resources at a particular scope.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- All resources _should_ include a list operation at its immediate parent scope\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - For **Tenant Resources**, this is at the tenant scope\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - For **Extension Resources**, this is at the scope of resources they are extending\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - For **Tracked Resources**, this is at the resource group scope.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - For **Child Resources**, this is at the scope of the resource parent.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Tracked resources _must_ include a list operation at the Subscription level.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Operation          | TypeSpec                                                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ListByParent       | `listByWidget is ArmResourceListByParent\\\\\\\\u003cResourceType\\\\\\\\u003e`     |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ListBySubscription | `listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003cResourceType\\\\\\\\u003e` |\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_resource_manager_rpc\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"v1.0#common-api-details.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Common API Details\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/cloud-and-ai-microsoft/resource-provider-contract/blob/master/v1.0/common-api-details.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Common API Details\\\\\\\\n## Request Query Parameters ##\\\\\\\\n# v1.0#common-api-details.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Common API Details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Request Query Parameters ##\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nARM will proxy request parameters (e.g. $filter; $expand; $skipToken; etc.) as-is to the Resource Providers.

Can we remove this model? (omit-unreachable-types: true does not work)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the `OkResponse` model is being emitted but not actually referenced, that does sound like a bug \\\\u2014 we shouldn't be generating unused models. Especially in cases like this where you're doing a long-running POST action and the 200 response is effectively empty, it\\\\u2019s more accurate to model the operation with just a `202` and an error response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor your case, you can avoid using `OkResponse` entirely by switching to `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync` or passing `never` as the third argument. That will prevent the generation of the unnecessary `OkResponse` model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, keep in mind that for LROs, the POST operation typically doesn't return 200 anyway. That response is just a placeholder in the old pattern to signal \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"void\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". If you're converting from existing Swagger, and it doesn\\\\u2019t actually return 200, you should be able to safely drop that response from the Swagger and avoid the breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, if you do need to customize the final response for the LRO, `getLroResponse` can be used to override the response returned at the end of the operation \\\\u2014 no need to rely on `OkResponse` at all.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n# TSP Install fails with below error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## question \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am trying to install TSP and its dependencies and it fails with below error.

This is because ARM acts as a front door for all control plane APIs and a standardized uri scheme allows it to route these APIs appropriately. ARM requires specific operations to have a specific number of segments in the uri. For eg: a PUT operation must always be performed against an even segmented uri path. ARM also interprets the intent of an operation based on the number of segments and applies custom logic to API invocations. For eg: A list call is distinguished from a GET on a single object based on detecting an odd segmented API path. When LIST calls are issued at the subscription or resource group scope, the call is fanned out to all regions where the resource type is registered in order to create a consolidated view of all resources in the collection.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is the uri scheme that must be implemented for each scope\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Scope | Http Methods [Variant] | URI |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- |

We\\\\u2019ll have to decide on the package name on a case-by-case basis.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe Azure Breaking Change and Azure SDK Architecture Boards are aware of this scenario and have agreed to approve these 1-time breaks related to splitting a monolithic SDK package into multiple service-specific packages so that engineering and customers can get on a long-term sustainable future. The Azure API Stewardship and ARM review Boards are also aware of this.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nCurrently, several Azure service teams have already decided to split their monolithic SDK package into service specific SDK packages: Compute, Monitor, Container Registry, Observability, AI Language, AI Speech, and more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor service teams violating the above service versioning rules, their current monolithic SDK package must be split into separate service-specific SDK packages. The good news is that this 1-time break for customers is fairly simple for them.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFirst, a customer can continue to use the SDK package they\\\\u2019re using today but this SDK package may never version ever again (more about this later).   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen a service introduces a new version, that service will now get its own/new SDK package that hereafter versions 1:1 with the service itself. A customer that wants to leverage the new service version will have to import a new SDK package that they never imported before. However, all the structures, classes, \\\\\\\\u0026 methods in this new package are identical to what they were called in the old monolithic package. Depending on the language, some customers may just have to import a new namespace or rename a package name in their code; the code that actually references the structures, classes, \\\\\\\\u0026 methods requires no change.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe last service to split-off from the monolithic SDK package may either get its own/new SDK package and name (as described in the previous paragraph) or it may stay in a new version of the original SDK package (same name as before). But, in this new package version, everything related to the already split-out services no longer exists. This latter scenario reduces some customer pain, but the name of the package may not accurately reflect the name of the remaining service. We\\\\u2019ll have to decide on the package name on a case-by-case basis.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe Azure Breaking Change and Azure SDK Architecture Boards are aware of this scenario and have agreed to approve these 1-time breaks related to splitting a monolithic SDK package into multiple service-specific packages so that engineering and customers can get on a long-term sustainable future.

[This PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36645/files) is one such example. It is adding two new suppressions to a new API version, but the suppressions themselves _already exist_ for a previous API version. In this case, `summarize impact` _intentionally_ evaluates this PR to not need suppression review.

However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI am reaching out to seek advice about versioning the LRO header: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Define contract for Batch RuleSet feature by mangoo1 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #37879 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-s\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/37879)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nis about to extend an existing RuleSet PUT endpoint to allow it accepting an optional request body, the feature would be turned on when we specify a bool flag to true and the PUT endpoint would be extend to 201 LRO.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis behavior would be available on the new ApiVersion, so I would like to put the Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia annotation to the new ApiVersion, along with LRO/Async headers ArmAsyncOperationHeader\\\\\\\\u003cFinalResult = RuleSet\\\\\\\\u003e and ArmLroLocationHeader\\\\\\\\u003cFinalResult = RuleSet\\\\\\\\u003e.

typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Release new api version process with TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi folks, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nDo you have any process or script to execute when creating a new api version with TypeSpec which is similar to current [Copy-ApiVersion.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/eng/scripts/Copy-ApiVersion.ps1) script with API Spec?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs within the TypeSpec, those examples needs to be added manually and change the api version in it. I wonder if there are any existing script for doing this. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSPec, this is much simpler.  You don't need to replicate your old APIs, you just encode the changes in the api and tag them with decorators from the versioning library, as discussed here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning/) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will need to copy the example files from the example directory from the last version into a new example directory for the new version, and add any new examples. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask questions here, or come to our office hours on Monday.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Handling multiple API versions using typespec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Handling multiple API versions using typespec\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Handling multiple API versions using typespec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi Team, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am releasing a new API version and looks there is a new validation to check existing swagger with new tsp file  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"appears to contain TypeSpec-generated swagger files, not generated from the current TypeSpec sources. Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins. What is the suggestion here? Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion,  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s the recommended way to change only the documentation (description/comments) between API versions while keeping all properties and models the same?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFrom what I understand, versioning decorators don\\\\u2019t apply to descriptions/comments, so doc changes propagate to all emitted JSON/OpenAPI versions.

However, you must ensure that the new operation signature is actually different\\\\u2014typically by adding a new parameter model for the filter, and using the `Parameters` template argument of `ArmListBySubscription`.\\\\n\\\\nHere's the recommended approach:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Define a parameters model for the filter** (and any other query parameters you want to support):\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nmodel OfferingListParameters {\\\\n  @query(\\\\\\\"filter\\\\\\\")\\\\n  filter?: string;\\\\n  // Add other query parameters as needed\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n2. **Version the operation using @removed and @added decorators**. The new operation should use the `Parameters` argument:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Offerings {\\\\n  // Old operation (no filter)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering>;\\\\n\\\\n  // New operation (with filter)\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering, Parameters = OfferingListParameters>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Key points:**\\\\n- The operation name (`listBySubscription`) can stay the same if you use @removed/@added to version the signature. The TypeSpec compiler will emit the correct operation for each version.\\\\n- If you want to keep both operations for some reason, you can use different names (e.g., `listBySubscriptionV2`), but the standard pattern is to keep the name and version the signature.\\\\n- Make sure your `Versions` enum is up to date and referenced correctly.\\\\n- The filter parameter should be optional unless you want to require it for all requests.\\\\n\\\\n**Why your previous attempts failed:**\\\\n- If you use the same operation signature for both @removed and @added, TypeSpec sees no difference and may not emit the correct versioned API. You must change the operation signature (by adding the parameters model) for the new version.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Offerings {\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering>;\\\\n\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Offering, Parameters = OfferingListParameters>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nThis will generate the correct OpenAPI for each version: the old version without filter, and the new version with filter support.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to support more query parameters, you can extend `OfferingListParameters` or use intersection types as shown in the references.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"For a case like this, just decorating the filter property with `@added` in the same operation is the simplest mechanism.  Versioning the request and response data in an operation like this is usually the most straightforward way to version an operation.\\\\nFor more complex operation versioning, you can use the remove/rename/sharedRoute mechanism described here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning/#converting-an-operation-from-synchronous-to-asynchronous)\\\\nNote also that you should name the property 'filter', the `@query(\\\\\\\"$filter\\\\\\\")` decorator actually sets the name on the wire,  you generally want to follow standard naming rules for parameters:\\\\n```\\\\n// v2 (new preview)\\\\nlistBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<\\\\nQuantumSuiteOffer,\\\\nParameters = {\\\\n/**\\\\n* The filter to apply to the operation.

            "answer": "To update the maximum value of `validityPeriodInDays` from 30 to 90 for only the new API version (`2025-11-01-preview`) in your TypeSpec definition, you must use TypeSpec's versioning patterns for breaking model changes. However, TypeSpec currently does not support versioning decorators on decorator arguments (like changing the `@maxValue` parameter per version). Directly updating the decorator value would affect all versions.\nThe correct Azure-compliant pattern is:\nCreate a new property (with a different internal name) for the updated constraint.\nUse `@removed` and `@renamedFrom` on the old property, and `@added` on the new property, both on the same model. This allows you to apply different constraints in different API versions without affecting other versions or causing duplicate operation errors.\nIf the operation signature/model type is changed for only the new version, use the add/remove/rename pattern and use `@sharedRoute` on both versions of the operation (see linked examples). This avoids the duplicate operation error and ensures correct OpenAPI emission for each version.\nExample:\n```\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\n// Old property: max 30 days, removed in new version\n@maxValue(30)\n@removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview, \"validityPeriodInDays\")\nvalidityPeriodInDaysV1: int32;\n// New property: max 90 days, only in new version\n@added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n@maxValue(90)\nvalidityPeriodInDays: int32;\n}\n```\nIn your operation/interface, you may need to do the same if the operation signature changes. If you want to have different models for different versions but keep the same route, use the `@sharedRoute` decorator and the `@renamedFrom` pattern for the operation as well (see the \"Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\" example in the docs).\nThis pattern will:\nPrevent duplicate operation errors (since each operation/model is only present in one version)\nEmit the correct schema per version\nNot require changing the operation name at the API surface (the renaming is internal)\nSummary:\nUse the add/remove/rename pattern for versioned property changes that affect validation/constraints.\nUse `@sharedRoute` and `@renamedFrom` for operations if the operation signature changes with the model.\nDo NOT update decorator arguments directly for just one version\u2014they affect all versions.",

            "answer": "The duplicate operation error in TypeSpec occurs because the HTTP emitter detects two operations with the same HTTP method and route, regardless of whether they use different models or property settings. In TypeSpec, versioning decorators like @added, @removed, and @renamedFrom are designed to help you evolve your API across versions, but they do not change the route or operation signature for the emitter. If you define two operations (e.g., 'getV1') with the same HTTP route in the same interface\u2014even if they use different models for different versions\u2014the emitter will treat them as duplicates and fail.\n\nTo resolve this, you should not duplicate the operation for each version. Instead, use versioning decorators on the model or property itself to indicate the change in the property constraint (such as the maximum value). For example, you can use @added or @removed on the property or model to specify when the change applies. If the constraint (e.g., maximum value) cannot be versioned directly, you may need to create a new model for the new version and use @renamedFrom to indicate the change, but ensure that only one operation per route exists in the interface, and the model is versioned appropriately.\n\nIf you need to change the model for a specific version, use the add/remove/rename pattern for the property or model, and decorate the operation to use the correct model for the target version. Do not duplicate the operation itself\u2014this will always cause a duplicate operation error.\n\nHere is a simplified example of how to version a property constraint in a model:\n\n```typespec\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\n  validityPeriodInDays: int32 @maxValue(30);\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\n  validityPeriodInDaysV2: int32 @maxValue(90);\n}\n\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Policies {\n  get is ArmResourceRead<LeafCertificateConfiguration>;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, only one 'get' operation exists, and the model is versioned using property decorators. If you need to change the model entirely, use @renamedFrom on the model, not the operation, and ensure only one operation per route is present.\n\nIf you still encounter issues, review your interface to ensure you do not have multiple operations with the same route and method, and apply versioning decorators to models and properties, not to duplicate operations.",

However, TypeSpec currently does not support versioning decorators on decorator arguments (like changing the `@maxValue` parameter per version). Directly updating the decorator value would affect all versions.\\\\nThe correct Azure-compliant pattern is:\\\\nCreate a new property (with a different internal name) for the updated constraint.\\\\nUse `@removed` and `@renamedFrom` on the old property, and `@added` on the new property, both on the same model. This allows you to apply different constraints in different API versions without affecting other versions or causing duplicate operation errors.\\\\nIf the operation signature/model type is changed for only the new version, use the add/remove/rename pattern and use `@sharedRoute` on both versions of the operation (see linked examples). This avoids the duplicate operation error and ensures correct OpenAPI emission for each version.\\\\nExample:\\\\n```\\\\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\\\\n// Old property: max 30 days, removed in new version\\\\n@maxValue(30)\\\\n@removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview, \\\\\\\"validityPeriodInDays\\\\\\\")\\\\nvalidityPeriodInDaysV1: int32;\\\\n// New property: max 90 days, only in new version\\\\n@added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n@maxValue(90)\\\\nvalidityPeriodInDays: int32;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nIn your operation/interface, you may need to do the same if the operation signature changes. If you want to have different models for different versions but keep the same route, use the `@sharedRoute` decorator and the `@renamedFrom` pattern for the operation as well (see the \\\\\\\"Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\" example in the docs).\\\\nThis pattern will:\\\\nPrevent duplicate operation errors (since each operation/model is only present in one version)\\\\nEmit the correct schema per version\\\\nNot require changing the operation name at the API surface (the renaming is internal)\\\\nSummary:\\\\nUse the add/remove/rename pattern for versioned property changes that affect validation/constraints.\\\\nUse `@sharedRoute` and `@renamedFrom` for operations if the operation signature changes with the model.\\\\nDo NOT update decorator arguments directly for just one version\\\\u2014they affect all versions.\\\"}\"}]",

Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_10_10.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning the LRO headers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI am reaching out to seek advice about versioning the LRO header: \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Define contract for Batch RuleSet feature by mangoo1 \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #37879 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-s\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/37879)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nis about to extend an existing RuleSet PUT endpoint to allow it accepting an optional request body, the feature would be turned on when we specify a bool flag to true and the PUT endpoint would be extend to 201 LRO.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis behavior would be available on the new ApiVersion, so I would like to put the Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia annotation to the new ApiVersion, along with LRO/Async headers ArmAsyncOperationHeader\\\\\\\\u003cFinalResult = RuleSet\\\\\\\\u003e and ArmLroLocationHeader\\\\\\\\u003cFinalResult = RuleSet\\\\\\\\u003e.

I wonder if there are any existing script for doing this. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSPec, this is much simpler.  You don't need to replicate your old APIs, you just encode the changes in the api and tag them with decorators from the versioning library, as discussed here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning/) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will need to copy the example files from the example directory from the last version into a new example directory for the new version, and add any new examples. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask questions here, or come to our office hours on Monday.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"docs#design#api-specs#api-typespec.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"What is TypeSpec?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# What is TypeSpec?\\\\\\\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\\\\\\\n# docs#design#api-specs#api-typespec.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# What is TypeSpec?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhether you're working with Data Plane (DP) or Azure Resource Manager (ARM), having clear examples to follow can make your transition to TypeSpec smoother.

Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins.

Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_07_03.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"How to update any model without affecting old API versions\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# How to update any model without affecting old API versions\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_07_03.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How to update any model without affecting old API versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi team,  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI have a model in the v2_preview version, and now with the new v3_preview version, I want to update a pattern and add some additional fields.

So, modifying them directly will affect all versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are two main approaches:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWorkaround with a new model: You can create a new model with a different name and use @renamedFrom, but this leads to a cascade of renames across operations, which is not ideal.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nApply the change across all versions: If the new regex is backwards compatible, and the change reflects how the service actually behaves across all versions, then it\\\\u2019s appropriate to update the existing model and apply the change to all API versions. This avoids inconsistencies and unnecessary duplication.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn practice, name validation changes usually apply across all versions, so updating the shared model is acceptable. Just be aware that this may be considered a breaking change depending on your service\\\\u2019s governance, and you might need approval.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_08_21.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec: How can I change only descriptions/comments between versions while keeping models identical?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi TypeSpec Discussion,  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s the recommended way to change only the documentation (description/comments) between API versions while keeping all properties and models the same?\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFrom what I understand, versioning decorators don\\\\u2019t apply to descriptions/comments, so doc changes propagate to all emitted JSON/OpenAPI versions.

In TypeSpec, versioning decorators like @added, @removed, and @renamedFrom are designed to help you evolve your API across versions, but they do not change the route or operation signature for the emitter. If you define two operations (e.g., 'getV1') with the same HTTP route in the same interface\\\\u2014even if they use different models for different versions\\\\u2014the emitter will treat them as duplicates and fail.\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this, you should not duplicate the operation for each version. Instead, use versioning decorators on the model or property itself to indicate the change in the property constraint (such as the maximum value). For example, you can use @added or @removed on the property or model to specify when the change applies. If the constraint (e.g., maximum value) cannot be versioned directly, you may need to create a new model for the new version and use @renamedFrom to indicate the change, but ensure that only one operation per route exists in the interface, and the model is versioned appropriately.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to change the model for a specific version, use the add/remove/rename pattern for the property or model, and decorate the operation to use the correct model for the target version. Do not duplicate the operation itself\\\\u2014this will always cause a duplicate operation error.\\\\n\\\\nHere is a simplified example of how to version a property constraint in a model:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\\\\n  validityPeriodInDays: int32 @maxValue(30);\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n  validityPeriodInDaysV2: int32 @maxValue(90);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Policies {\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead<LeafCertificateConfiguration>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, only one 'get' operation exists, and the model is versioned using property decorators. If you need to change the model entirely, use @renamedFrom on the model, not the operation, and ensure only one operation per route is present.\\\\n\\\\nIf you still encounter issues, review your interface to ensure you do not have multiple operations with the same route and method, and apply versioning decorators to models and properties, not to duplicate operations.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"To update the maximum value of `validityPeriodInDays` from 30 to 90 for only the new API version (`2025-11-01-preview`) in your TypeSpec definition, you must use TypeSpec's versioning patterns for breaking model changes. However, TypeSpec currently does not support versioning decorators on decorator arguments (like changing the `@maxValue` parameter per version). Directly updating the decorator value would affect all versions.\\\\nThe correct Azure-compliant pattern is:\\\\nCreate a new property (with a different internal name) for the updated constraint.\\\\nUse `@removed` and `@renamedFrom` on the old property, and `@added` on the new property, both on the same model. This allows you to apply different constraints in different API versions without affecting other versions or causing duplicate operation errors.\\\\nIf the operation signature/model type is changed for only the new version, use the add/remove/rename pattern and use `@sharedRoute` on both versions of the operation (see linked examples). This avoids the duplicate operation error and ensures correct OpenAPI emission for each version.\\\\nExample:\\\\n```\\\\nmodel LeafCertificateConfiguration {\\\\n// Old property: max 30 days, removed in new version\\\\n@maxValue(30)\\\\n@removed(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview, \\\\\\\"validityPeriodInDays\\\\\\\")\\\\nvalidityPeriodInDaysV1: int32;\\\\n// New property: max 90 days, only in new version\\\\n@added(Versions.v2025_11_01_preview)\\\\n@maxValue(90)\\\\nvalidityPeriodInDays: int32;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nIn your operation/interface, you may need to do the same if the operation signature changes. If you want to have different models for different versions but keep the same route, use the `@sharedRoute` decorator and the `@renamedFrom` pattern for the operation as well (see the \\\\\\\"Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\" example in the docs).\\\\nThis pattern will:\\\\nPrevent duplicate operation errors (since each operation/model is only present in one version)\\\\nEmit the correct schema per version\\\\nNot require changing the operation name at the API surface (the renaming is internal)\\\\nSummary:\\\\nUse the add/remove/rename pattern for versioned property changes that affect validation/constraints.\\\\nUse `@sharedRoute` and `@renamedFrom` for operations if the operation signature changes with the model.\\\\nDo NOT update decorator arguments directly for just one version\\\\u2014they affect all versions.\\\"}\"}]",

            "answer": "You cannot directly version a decorator such as @pattern in TypeSpec; decorators themselves are not versioned. This means that if you update a pattern in your TypeSpec model, it will apply to all API versions emitted by TypeSpec, not just a new version. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid hidden inconsistencies between the declared API surface and the actual backend behavior.\nIf you need different validation patterns (such as a new regex for a resource name) for a specific API version and newer, you have two supported options in TypeSpec:\nIf the new pattern applies to all versions: Update the @pattern decorator in the model directly. This is the common and recommended path if your backend enforces the new pattern for all versions.\nIf the pattern truly differs by API version (rare, and usually discouraged): You must explicitly version the type. For example, you can introduce a new scalar type or model for the new version, and use the @typeChangedFrom or @renamedFrom decorators to describe the transition between versions. This approach requires you to manage versioning logic in TypeSpec, not in the generated OpenAPI/JSON files. You should not edit the generated files by hand, and manual changes to JSON files are not supported.\nHere's a sketch of the pattern versioning approach:\n```\n/** Legacy pattern type for old API versions */\n@pattern(\"^[a-z0-9]{3,18}$\")\nscalar ResourceNameLegacy extends string;\nmodel MyResource {\n@key(\"resourceName\")\n@typeChangedFrom(Versions.v2, ResourceNameLegacy)\n@pattern(\"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$\")\nname: string;\n}\n```\nIn this example, TypeSpec will emit the old pattern for older API versions and the new pattern for v2 and above, but you must structure your code accordingly. Note that this approach can lead to more complicated TypeSpec code and is only justified if your backend actually enforces different rules per API version.\nSummary: Do not manually edit JSON files generated by TypeSpec. Use versioning decorators and, if necessary, versioned types to achieve per-version differences. But for most cases, apply the new pattern universally if the service behavior matches. This approach keeps your TypeSpec code clear and maintainable.",

This means that if you update a pattern in your TypeSpec model, it will apply to all API versions emitted by TypeSpec, not just a new version. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid hidden inconsistencies between the declared API surface and the actual backend behavior.\\\\nIf you need different validation patterns (such as a new regex for a resource name) for a specific API version and newer, you have two supported options in TypeSpec:\\\\nIf the new pattern applies to all versions: Update the @pattern decorator in the model directly. This is the common and recommended path if your backend enforces the new pattern for all versions.\\\\nIf the pattern truly differs by API version (rare, and usually discouraged): You must explicitly version the type. For example, you can introduce a new scalar type or model for the new version, and use the @typeChangedFrom or @renamedFrom decorators to describe the transition between versions. This approach requires you to manage versioning logic in TypeSpec, not in the generated OpenAPI/JSON files. You should not edit the generated files by hand, and manual changes to JSON files are not supported.\\\\nHere's a sketch of the pattern versioning approach:\\\\n```\\\\n/** Legacy pattern type for old API versions */\\\\n@pattern(\\\\\\\"^[a-z0-9]{3,18}$\\\\\\\")\\\\nscalar ResourceNameLegacy extends string;\\\\nmodel MyResource {\\\\n@key(\\\\\\\"resourceName\\\\\\\")\\\\n@typeChangedFrom(Versions.v2, ResourceNameLegacy)\\\\n@pattern(\\\\\\\"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$\\\\\\\")\\\\nname: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nIn this example, TypeSpec will emit the old pattern for older API versions and the new pattern for v2 and above, but you must structure your code accordingly. Note that this approach can lead to more complicated TypeSpec code and is only justified if your backend actually enforces different rules per API version.\\\\nSummary: Do not manually edit JSON files generated by TypeSpec. Use versioning decorators and, if necessary, versioned types to achieve per-version differences. But for most cases, apply the new pattern universally if the service behavior matches. This approach keeps your TypeSpec code clear and maintainable.\\\"}\"}]",

If this causes a breaking change warning, you may need to go through the breaking change review process, but this is the correct modeling approach.\\\\n\\\\nYou cannot scope a pattern restriction to only new versions using TypeSpec decorators at this time.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You cannot directly version a decorator such as @pattern in TypeSpec; decorators themselves are not versioned. This means that if you update a pattern in your TypeSpec model, it will apply to all API versions emitted by TypeSpec, not just a new version. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid hidden inconsistencies between the declared API surface and the actual backend behavior.\\\\nIf you need different validation patterns (such as a new regex for a resource name) for a specific API version and newer, you have two supported options in TypeSpec:\\\\nIf the new pattern applies to all versions: Update the @pattern decorator in the model directly. This is the common and recommended path if your backend enforces the new pattern for all versions.\\\\nIf the pattern truly differs by API version (rare, and usually discouraged): You must explicitly version the type. For example, you can introduce a new scalar type or model for the new version, and use the @typeChangedFrom or @renamedFrom decorators to describe the transition between versions. This approach requires you to manage versioning logic in TypeSpec, not in the generated OpenAPI/JSON files. You should not edit the generated files by hand, and manual changes to JSON files are not supported.\\\\nHere's a sketch of the pattern versioning approach:\\\\n```\\\\n/** Legacy pattern type for old API versions */\\\\n@pattern(\\\\\\\"^[a-z0-9]{3,18}$\\\\\\\")\\\\nscalar ResourceNameLegacy extends string;\\\\nmodel MyResource {\\\\n@key(\\\\\\\"resourceName\\\\\\\")\\\\n@typeChangedFrom(Versions.v2, ResourceNameLegacy)\\\\n@pattern(\\\\\\\"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$\\\\\\\")\\\\nname: string;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nIn this example, TypeSpec will emit the old pattern for older API versions and the new pattern for v2 and above, but you must structure your code accordingly. Note that this approach can lead to more complicated TypeSpec code and is only justified if your backend actually enforces different rules per API version.\\\\nSummary: Do not manually edit JSON files generated by TypeSpec. Use versioning decorators and, if necessary, versioned types to achieve per-version differences. But for most cases, apply the new pattern universally if the service behavior matches. This approach keeps your TypeSpec code clear and maintainable.\\\"}\"}]",

            "answer": "To version LRO headers and related behavior (such as using Azure.Core.useFinalStateVia, ArmAsyncOperationHeader, and ArmLroLocationHeader) in TypeSpec for a new API version, you should use TypeSpec's versioning decorators and operation templates in combination with @sharedRoute and operation renaming/removal. \n\nHere's the recommended approach:\n\n1. **Use @sharedRoute and Operation Renaming/Removal**: \n   - Define the old operation (without LRO headers and with a required request body) and the new operation (with LRO headers, optional request body, and new LRO behavior) on the same route using @sharedRoute.\n   - Use @renamedFrom and @removed decorators to indicate when the old operation is replaced by the new one.\n\n2. **Version the Operation, Not the LRO Header Directly**: \n   - You cannot directly put @added(version) on the LRO header types (like ArmAsyncOperationHeader or ArmLroLocationHeader), but you can version the operation itself. The operation template (e.g., Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync) will take the LRO header as a parameter, so the new operation will use the new header and behavior only in the new version.\n\n3. **Make the Request Body Optional for Backwards Compatibility**: \n   - In the new version, use the OptionalRequestBody = true parameter in the operation template to allow the request body to be optional.\n\n4. **Example TypeSpec**:\n\n```typespec\n@armResourceOperations\ninterface Employees {\n  get is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;\n\n  // Old operation (removed in new version)\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`, \"createOrUpdate\")\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`)\n  @sharedRoute\n  createOrUpdateOld is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;\n\n  // New operation (added in new version)\n  @sharedRoute\n  createOrUpdate is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync<\n    Employee,\n    OptionalRequestBody = true\n  >;\n  // ... other operations ...\n}\n```\n\n- The old operation is removed in the new version, and the new operation (with LRO headers and optional request body) is used instead.\n- The @sharedRoute decorator ensures both operations use the same route.\n- The new operation uses the correct LRO header and behavior for the new version.\n\nThis approach is fully aligned with Azure API versioning best practices and TypeSpec's versioning model. You do not need to (and cannot) put @added directly on the LRO header types; versioning the operation is the correct and recommended way.\n\nIf you need to see a full playground example, see the [TypeSpec Azure Playground](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground/?options=%7B%22linterRuleSet%22%3A%7B%22extends%22%3A%5B%22%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-azure-rulesets%2Fresource-manager%22%5D%7D%7D&c=aW1wb3J0ICJAdHlwZXNwZWMvaHR0cCI7...) for a working sample.",

I wonder if there are any existing script for doing this. Thanks!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSPec, this is much simpler.  You don't need to replicate your old APIs, you just encode the changes in the api and tag them with decorators from the versioning library, as discussed here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning/) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou will need to copy the example files from the example directory from the last version into a new example directory for the new version, and add any new examples. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask questions here, or come to our office hours on Monday.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_rest_api_specs_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Swagger-LintDiff.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n# Swagger-LintDiff.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck `Swagger LintDiff` may fail for the OpenAPI generated from TypeSpec, even if there are no warnings or errors reported from the TypeSpec compiler.

Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins. What is the suggestion here? Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning\\\\\\\\n## Using the `@added` Decorator\\\\\\\\n# getting-started#getting-started-rest#06-versioning.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Using the `@added` Decorator\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`@added`](../../../libraries/versioning/reference/decorators/#@TypeSpec.Versioning.added) decorator is used to indicate that a model or operation was added in a specific version of the API.

The operation template (e.g., Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync) will take the LRO header as a parameter, so the new operation will use the new header and behavior only in the new version.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Make the Request Body Optional for Backwards Compatibility**: \\\\n   - In the new version, use the OptionalRequestBody = true parameter in the operation template to allow the request body to be optional.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Example TypeSpec**:\\\\n\\\\n```typespec\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;\\\\n\\\\n  // Old operation (removed in new version)\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`, \\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\")\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`)\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\n  createOrUpdateOld is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;\\\\n\\\\n  // New operation (added in new version)\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\n  createOrUpdate is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync<\\\\n    Employee,\\\\n    OptionalRequestBody = true\\\\n  >;\\\\n  // ... other operations ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- The old operation is removed in the new version, and the new operation (with LRO headers and optional request body) is used instead.\\\\n- The @sharedRoute decorator ensures both operations use the same route.\\\\n- The new operation uses the correct LRO header and behavior for the new version.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach is fully aligned with Azure API versioning best practices and TypeSpec's versioning model. You do not need to (and cannot) put @added directly on the LRO header types; versioning the operation is the correct and recommended way.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to see a full playground example, see the [TypeSpec Azure Playground](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground/?options=%7B%22linterRuleSet%22%3A%7B%22extends%22%3A%5B%22%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-azure-rulesets%2Fresource-manager%22%5D%7D%7D&c=aW1wb3J0ICJAdHlwZXNwZWMvaHR0cCI7...) for a working sample.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"here's a [playground](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground/?options=%7B%22linterRuleSet%22%3A%7B%22extends%22%3A%5B%22%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-azure-rulesets%2Fresource-manager%22%5D%7D%7D&c=aW1wb3J0ICJAdHlwZXNwZWMvaHR0cCI7CtIZcmVzdNUZdmVyc2lvbmluZ8wfYXp1cmUtdG9vbHMvyCstxhVjb3Jl3yvIK3Jlc291cmNlLW1hbmFnZXIiOwoKdXNpbmcgSHR0cDvHDFJlc3TIDFbpAI7IEkHESi5Db3JlzhJSx1xNxls7CgovKiogQ29udG9zb8RUxR4gUHJvdmlkZXIg5gCDbWVudCBBUEkuICovCkBhcm3IIE5hbWVzcGFjZQpAc2VydmljZSgjeyB0aXRsZTogIsdXyC1IdWJDbGllbnQiIH0pCkDnAUNlZCjnAL9zKQpuyFAgTWljcm9zb2Z0LtJG7wC2QVBJIMdNc%2BQAoWVudW3oARNzIHsKICDELjIwMjUtMTAtMDEtcHJldmlld8g1xDQgIOQA10NvbW1vblTkAY%2FHQCj1ATcuyykuyGoudjUpCiAgYNJpYCwK8ACFN%2F8Ahf8Ahf8AhesAhclpYCwKfeYBOEHoATrrAVMg6AJ15ACIbW9kZWwgRW1wbG95ZWUgaXMgVHJhY2tlZOgAgjzIHFByb3BlcnRpZXM%2B5QFpLi7pAKbkAhtQYXJhbWV0ZXLJMT476ACGyV9wyUTSfMpg6QHIQWdlIG9mIGXIP%2BUBOGFnZT86IGludDMyO%2BgBbENpdHnSKmNpdHk%2FOiBzdHLlAy7HLFByb2ZpbNNZQGVuY29kZSgiYmFzZTY0dXJsIuQBYHDGMD86IGJ5dGVzyUhUaGUgc3RhdHVzxEt0aGUgbGFzdCDkAMVhdGlvbuUDQSAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAeBhZMddxCDlA9BTdGF0xGflAavMFOkBSMRzzDLlAIDlAMph6QHVxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQCctFU5QFk5gEa6QKyxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QTq6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBULHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QP96QN3bW926gHK6QN5TW92ZVLHFegDcsRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA1DLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBIvmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AZhT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYHIy7LKXt9CuUG%2F8gjyhvLWegAzeYEs2dldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFEOQEEHJl5Ab6ZEZyb23pBw4u9QXFICLmAqlPcuUC1WXlBI9AcmXkAPzqB0rVPMUqc2hhcmVkUm91dGXkBQ7NTE9sZO8ArEPHIFJlcGxhY2VBc3luY%2BwAvN9RxU71AVVMZWdhY3ku1WAKICAg6QFGLMUOT3DkAWZhbOcCm0JvZHkgPSB0cnXEdOUAiOUD%2FMZxcm1DdXN0b21QYXRjaFPXUvYAl0ZvdW7kBCvkAUPIHOYAy03kAonGSdBLyhDqBq%2FFGT7oAJ3mA5%2FvAVzlA5xlV2l0aG91dE9r8wFcbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3Jp5QE%2BxzvGM8wZzDnoB2Ugc2FtcGzrBGthY8VEdGhhdOYDaOkHKHRvIGRpZmZl5ACE7wPrxSnuALJBxUjlAZbIdyzsBHbIDeYD7fMAkkhFQUTqB1HEfmNoZWNr6gCqZXhpc3RlbuYIyyDGHkXJFO8C4M0d7gim&e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest&vs=%7B%7D) showing how you would version a required to optional request body for a templated async put operation:\\\\n```\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\nget is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;\\\\n@renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`, \\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\")\\\\n@removed(Versions.`2025-10-07-preview`)\\\\n@sharedRoute\\\\ncreateOrUpdateOld is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;\\\\n@sharedRoute\\\\ncreateOrUpdate is Azure.ResourceManager.Legacy.CreateOrReplaceAsync<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nOptionalRequestBody = true\\\\n>;\\\\nupdate is ArmCustomPatchSync<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nAzure.ResourceManager.Foundations.ResourceUpdateModel<\\\\nEmployee,\\\\nEmployeeProperties\\\\n>\\\\n>;\\\\ndelete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Employee>;\\\\nlistByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;\\\\nlistBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;\\\\n/** A sample resource action that move employee to different location */\\\\nmove is ArmResourceActionSync<Employee, MoveRequest, MoveResponse>;\\\\n/** A sample HEAD operation to check resource existence */\\\\ncheckExistence is ArmResourceCheckExistence<Employee>;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nthe trick is to use @sharedRoute in the old and new operations and to rename and remove the old operation in the new version.\\\"}\"}]",

'age' appears in the second, stable version and all subsequent versions,  'profile' appears in the first (preview) version, is removed in the stable version, and then added back again in the subsequent preview version.\nNotably, this practice of adding a property at each preview version and removing it at each stable is easy to get wrong.\nthe official Azure policy is to have only one active preview, as much as that is possible with api retention requirements.  So that, when you introduce a new preview version, the older preview is removed, ideally, this means that, especially when you just had a stable release, you remove support for the previous preview when (or soon after) you add the new preview version.\nYou can see more details about versioning in typespec here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/versioning/)",

            "answer": "Yes, in TypeSpec you can create a stable API version that omits select properties, while allowing those properties to exist in multiple preview versions. The recommended approach is to use the @added and @removed decorators to precisely control which versions a property appears in. \n\nHere's how it works:\n- When you introduce a property in a preview version, use @added(Versions.<preview_version>). This will include the property in that preview and all subsequent versions unless you explicitly remove it.\n- To exclude the property from a stable version, use @removed(Versions.<stable_version>). This will remove the property from the stable version and all subsequent versions, unless you add it back with another @added decorator in a later preview.\n- If you want the property to appear in multiple preview versions but not in any stable version, you must use @added and @removed in combination for each version transition.\n\nFor example, suppose you have preview versions 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview, and stable versions in between. You can do:\n\n```tsp\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\n  // Property appears in first preview\n  @added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_03_01)\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\n\n  // Property reappears in next preview\n  @added(Versions.v2025_03_01_preview)\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_06_01)\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\n\n  // Property reappears in next preview\n  @added(Versions.v2025_06_01_preview)\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_07_01)\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\n\n  // Property reappears in latest preview\n  @added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern ensures that faultSimulation is present only in the preview versions and omitted from all stable releases. However, this approach can be error-prone and verbose, so it's best to minimize the number of active preview versions. The official Azure policy is to have only one active preview version at a time, retiring older previews when a new one is introduced.\n\nYou can have multiple versions marked with @previewVersion, but only the latest preview should be active according to Azure guidelines. When you add a new preview, you should remove support for the previous preview soon after.\n\nFor more details and best practices, see the Azure TypeSpec versioning documentation and the example provided in the references.",

We have some properties that we don't want to include in a stable release just yet, but don't want that to hold us from releasing the other properties in a stable release.\\\\nCan we have multiple versions marked with @previewVersion? How do we handle a property that is in multiple preview versions, but we want to keep out of stable versions?\\\\nFor a practical example, we have the faultSimulation apis in our spec in 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview. If I mark 2025-07-01-preview with @previewVersion and faultSimulation with @added(versions.v2025_07_01_preview), the generation removes it from the previous preview specs.\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"Yes, in TypeSpec you can create a stable API version that omits select properties, while allowing those properties to exist in multiple preview versions. The recommended approach is to use the @added and @removed decorators to precisely control which versions a property appears in. \\\\n\\\\nHere's how it works:\\\\n- When you introduce a property in a preview version, use @added(Versions.<preview_version>). This will include the property in that preview and all subsequent versions unless you explicitly remove it.\\\\n- To exclude the property from a stable version, use @removed(Versions.<stable_version>). This will remove the property from the stable version and all subsequent versions, unless you add it back with another @added decorator in a later preview.\\\\n- If you want the property to appear in multiple preview versions but not in any stable version, you must use @added and @removed in combination for each version transition.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, suppose you have preview versions 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview, and stable versions in between. You can do:\\\\n\\\\n```tsp\\\\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\\\\n  // Property appears in first preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_03_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property reappears in next preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_03_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_06_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property reappears in next preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_06_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_07_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property reappears in latest preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern ensures that faultSimulation is present only in the preview versions and omitted from all stable releases. However, this approach can be error-prone and verbose, so it's best to minimize the number of active preview versions. The official Azure policy is to have only one active preview version at a time, retiring older previews when a new one is introduced.\\\\n\\\\nYou can have multiple versions marked with @previewVersion, but only the latest preview should be active according to Azure guidelines. When you add a new preview, you should remove support for the previous preview soon after.\\\\n\\\\nFor more details and best practices, see the Azure TypeSpec versioning documentation and the example provided in the references.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"TypeSpec versioning works in the following way:\\\\nAll types in the spec are automatically part of the initial api-version\\\\nWhen a new api-version is introduced,  any new types `use@added(VERSION)` decorators to indicate they were added in that version, they are impliciutly included in every subsequent version\\\\nWhen a type does not appear in one version, then you use `@removed(VERSION)` to remove the type at that version, by default, it will not appear any subsequent versions.

If I mark 2025-07-01-preview with @previewVersion and faultSimulation with @added(versions.v2025_07_01_preview), the generation removes it from the previous preview specs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLlBIPHLFByb2ZpbNR5cmVtb3bce%2FQAm%2FABm8UoZW5jb2RlKCJiYXNlNjR1cmwixBdwxno%2FOiBieXRlc%2BkAklRoZSBzdGF0dXPkAJV0aGUgbGFzdCDkAS9hdGlvbuUE4CAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAkphZMddxCDlBW9TdGF0xGflAhXMFOkBssRzzDLlAIDlARRh6QI%2FxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQDHNFU5QHO5gFk6QNcxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QaJ6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBuHHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QRn6QPh5AMh6QHK6QPjTW92ZVLHFegD3MRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA5rLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBPXmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AgAT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYIwi7LKXt9CuUInsgjyhvLWegAzeYFHWdldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFeiDnAntPcuUCp%2BUB1ssvQ8cdUmVwbGFjZUFzeW5jzj%2FlAvfIN0N1c3RvbVBhdGNoU8QqCiAgIOkAkyzFDvYA50ZvdW7kAybkBQ7IHOYAkU3kAYTGSdBLyhDqBhTFGT4KICDlAJ3mAprvANTlApdlV2l0aG91dE9r8wDUbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3JpcOUCecY7xjPMGcw56AbKIHNhbXBs6wNmYWPFRHRoYXTmAmPpBm10byBkaWZmZeQAhO8C5sUp7gCyQcVI5QGWyHcs7ANxyA3mAujzAJJIRUFE6gZMxH5jaGVja%2BoAqmV4aXN0ZW7mCDAgxh5FyRTvAljNHe4ICw%3D%3D\\\\\\\\u0026e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest\\\\\\\\u0026vs=%7B%7D) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2021-10-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2024-10-01 version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2024-10-01`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2024-10-01`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Age of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age?: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** City of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Profile of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-07-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @encode(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"base64url\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  profile?: bytes;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The status of the last operation. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningState?: ProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nshowing two propertties (EmployeeProperties.age and EmployeeProperties.profile) that use versioning.

To achieve this, you can use a combination of `@removed`, `@added`, and `@renamedFrom` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"experience\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldExperience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read, Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  experience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Adding a Parameter to an Operation and Making Another Parameter Optional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario shows how to add a parameter and make another optional in an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following operation in v1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Make the `location` header parameter optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add a new optional query parameter `orderBy`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can achieve this using the `@madeOptional` and `@added` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @query(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order-by\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      orderBy?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@madeOptional(Versions.v2)` makes `location` optional starting in v2.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the `orderBy` query parameter in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario illustrates converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one across versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following synchronous operation in `v1`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you update this operation to be asynchronous as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdateV1 is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@removed(Versions.v2)` removes the original synchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` keeps the original name for v1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the new asynchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@sharedRoute` ensures both operations can use the same route.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#arm#versioning.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/versioning\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Versioning\\\\\\\\n# howtos#arm#versioning.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Versioning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document explains how to manage versioning in TypeSpec projects, including how to add, remove, or modify resources, operations, and properties across API versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Introduction\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVersioning allows you to evolve your API without breaking existing clients. By using versioning decorators, you can specify when resources, operations, or properties are added, removed, or changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Declaring Versions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDefine your API versions in an enum. For each version, specify dependencies and common types as needed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2022-11-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter defining your enum, link it to your namespace using the `@versioned` decorator:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Microsoft.ContosoProviderHub;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e **Note:** Add dependencies and common types for each version. After defining a new version, the emitter will produce outputs for all versions. You can then adapt your TypeSpec code for the latest version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Simple Scenarios\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese examples show how to add models, operations, properties, and parameters in specific versions using TypeSpec versioning decorators.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Adding Decoration to an Existing Type\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario demonstrates how to change a decorator\\\\u2019s usage across versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you have a model property with a decorator:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  experience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the next version (v2), the visibility changes so that the property can be read or created. To achieve this, you can use a combination of `@removed`, `@added`, and `@renamedFrom` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"experience\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldExperience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read, Lifecycle.Create)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  experience: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Adding a Parameter to an Operation and Making Another Parameter Optional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario shows how to add a parameter and make another optional in an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following operation in v1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Make the `location` header parameter optional.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Add a new optional query parameter `orderBy`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nYou can achieve this using the `@madeOptional` and `@added` decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Employee,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    Parameters = {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @header\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      location?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      @query(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order-by\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      orderBy?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@madeOptional(Versions.v2)` makes `location` optional starting in v2.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the `orderBy` query parameter in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis scenario illustrates converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one across versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nSuppose you start with the following synchronous operation in `v1`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn version `v2`, you update this operation to be asynchronous as follows:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdateV1 is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @sharedRoute\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@removed(Versions.v2)` removes the original synchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"createOrUpdate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")` keeps the original name for v1.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the new asynchronous operation in v2 and later.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `@sharedRoute` ensures both operations can use the same route.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Versioning Decorators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### @added\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can add new models, properties, or operations in a specific version and all subsequent versions using the `@added` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `version` argument is the version where the element is introduced.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The element will be present in that version and all later versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example: Adding a model and property across versions**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example, suppose you want to add a new model and then add a property to it in a later version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v1: No Employee model exists\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v2: Add Employee model\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v3: Add 'city' property to Employee\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example: Adding an operation in a later version**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // v3: Add createOrUpdate operation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### @removed\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remove models, properties, or operations starting from a specific version, use the `@removed` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `version` argument is the version where the element is removed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The element will not be present in that version or any later versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example: Removing a property and a model across versions**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v1: Employee model with 'city' property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v2: Remove 'city' property\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v3: Remove Employee model entirely\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@removed(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  name: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example: Removing an operation**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface Employees {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v3)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### @madeRequired and @madeOptional\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse these decorators to change whether a property is required or optional in a specific version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Use `@madeOptional(Versions.version)` to make a property optional starting in that version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Use `@madeRequired(Versions.version)` to make a property required starting in that version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example: Changing a property from required to optional, then back to required**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v1: movingStatus is required\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel MoveResponse {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  movingStatus: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v2: movingStatus becomes optional\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel MoveResponse {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  movingStatus?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### @renamedFrom\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse `@renamedFrom` to rename models, properties, operations, enums, etc., in a specific version.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `version` argument is the version where the name changed.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- The `oldName` argument is the previous name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example: Renaming a property and a model across versions**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v1: Model and property have original names\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel WorkerProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  state?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v2: Rename property 'state' to 'city'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel WorkerProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// v3: Rename model 'WorkerProperties' to 'EmployeeProperties'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"WorkerProperties\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## FAQ\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How do I version a pattern?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI have this model and I would like to change the pattern in v2\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @pattern(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"^[a-z]+$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  state: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::caution\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUpdating a pattern could be a breaking change:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- A **more restrictive pattern** for input data would break existing clients that send previously valid data\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- A **less restrictive pattern** for output data could break client assumptions and validation logic\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe key question is: **Does the pattern change apply to all API versions, or only to the new version?**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### 1. Pattern changes for all versions\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the pattern change reflects how your service actually behaves across all versions, update the pattern directly. The specification should accurately reflect the current state of your service.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`diff lang=tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n-  @pattern(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"^[a-z]+$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+  @pattern(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"^[a-zA-Z]+$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   state: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::note\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis will update all openapi specs versions with the new pattern which is the desired behavior.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n:::\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### 2. Different patterns per version (**Very unlikely**)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf older API versions truly enforce a different pattern than newer versions, you need to model this explicitly using versioning decorators:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @pattern(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"^[a-z]+$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"state\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldState: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @pattern(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"^[a-zA-Z]+$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  state:

translate\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec designs into OpenAPI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe document is organized around the features of an OpenAPI v2 or v3 definition.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe idea is that if you know how to describe some API feature in OpenAPI, you can just navigate\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nto the section of this document for that feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Data Types\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI

specified using the `type` and `format` fields in a schema.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec equivalents of OpenAPI data types are the TypeSpec primitive types or [built-in

   | `@maxItems(value)` decorator |       |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### enum\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to define an `enum` data type in TypeSpec. One is with the [TypeSpec `enum` statement](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/enums), e.g.:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- To retain the quotes from the enum values --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Color {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"red\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"green\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAnother is to use the union operation to define the enum values inline, e.g.:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  size?: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"small\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"medium\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-large\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### default\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA model property that specifies a default value using \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will produce a `default` field in the schema for this property.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Example {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  answer?: int32 = 42;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  color?: string = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"purple\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nproduces\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=openapi.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nanswer:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: integer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  format: int32\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  default: 42\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncolor:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  type: string\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  default: purple\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Host / BasePath / Servers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI v2, the `host` and `basePath` fields at the top-level of the API definition combine to form the base URL for the API. The paths defined in the `paths` object are appended to this base URL to form the absolute URL for an operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI v3, the top-level `servers` field specifies an array of `server` objects [[v3][v3-server]] with a base URL, which may be parameterized, to which the operation path is appended.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-server]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#server-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, the `host` in OpenAPI v2 or `servers` in OpenAPI v3 can be specified with the `@server` decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\non the namespace (from `@typespec/http` library). You can use this decorator multiple times to specify multiple servers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Paths Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI, the `paths` object [[v2][v2-paths], [v3][v3-paths]] is the top-level structure for defining the operations of the API, organized by the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"path\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v2-paths]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#paths-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-paths]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#paths-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, you can specify the path for a namespace, interface, or operation using the `@route` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the value of the `@route` decorator contains path parameters, operations within the scope of the decorator\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmust declare parameters with the same name and type. If an operation declares a path parameter that is not present\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin the route, this defines a new path that is the value from the `@route` decorator with the path parameter appended.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Pets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op create(@body pet: Pet): Pet; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op read(@path petId: int32): Pet; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/pets/{petId}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen the `@route` decorator is used within a namespace or interface that also has a `@route` decorator, the path is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nobtained by concatenating the routes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Widgets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  // widgets operations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/{id}/parts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  namespace Parts {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    op list(@path id: string): Part[] | Error; // uses path \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/widgets/{id}/parts\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Path Item Object\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn OpenAPI, a path item object [[v2][v2-pathitem], [v3][v3-pathitem]] describes the operations available on a single path. A path may have at most one `get`, `put`, `post`, `patch`, `delete`, or `head` operation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v2-pathitem]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#path-item-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[v3-pathitem]: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.3/versions/3.0.3.md#path-item-object\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn TypeSpec, operations are defined within a namespace or interface with a syntax similar to typescript functions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe HTTP method for an operation can be specified explicitly using a decorator: `@get`, `@put`, `@post`, `@patch`, `@delete`, or `@head`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf an HTTP method decorator is not specified then the default is `post` if there is a body and `get` otherwise.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@tag(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Gadgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@route(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/gadgets\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Gadgets {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op create(@body gadget: Gadget): Gadget | Error;

typespec_2025_09_26.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Changing Property to Optional with Default\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHi everyone, \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am making a property optional in typespec and to be a non-breaking change, I see that is required to have a default. However my change seems to also change the existing version instead of only the new version. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBefore:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists: SubResource[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAfter:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2025_10_01_preview)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @OpenAPI.extension(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-ms-identifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", #[])\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  dnsResolverDomainLists?: SubResource[] = #[]; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1) How can I make the change in typespec so that the generation of the openapi jsons will not affect the existing version? Currently generation also adds the empty array default to the existing API version (2025-05-01) which causes the breaking change CI to flag.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2) Is there a way I can default the SubResource[] array to null instead? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis is in accordance to the documentation here (Made optional with/without default case): [non-breaking-versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/non-breaking-versioning/#-incorrect)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMy PR: [Release 2025-10-01-preview for DNS Resolver by jamesvoongms \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #24470 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-res\\\\u2026](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/24470)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not add OpenApi extensions directly - x-ms-identifiers are automatically added based on the `@key` properties of a model,  or you should use the `@identifiers` decorator if you need to override the default setting. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that this is two changes (making a property optional and providing a default), but there is only versioning decoration for one change.  Compounding this, there is no versioning decoration for adding a default value, this is being tracked here: [Add additional versioning decorators \\\\u00b7 Issue #2761 \\\\u00b7 microsoft/typespec](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues/2761).  Ideally we should combine these two changes into a single decorator to promote non-breaking changes. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, you can do this using the added/removed/rename pattern to replace one property with another property in a new version, as this example.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  oldStuff: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-10-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @doc(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The stuff\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  stuff?: string[] = #[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"howtos#versioning#preview-version.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"How to define a preview version\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/versioning/preview-version\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# How to define a preview version\\\\\\\\n## Usage Examples\\\\\\\\n### New preview Version\\\\\\\\n# howtos#versioning#preview-version.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How to define a preview version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### New preview Version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the following example we introduce a new preview version called `v3Preview` which includes everything from `v2` plus adds a new property to the `Widget` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`diff lang=tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/rest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Http;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Rest;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Azure.Core;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Widget Service\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace DemoService;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v1,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+  @previewVersion\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+  v3Preview\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n * Model defining the Widget resource\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Widget {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * Identifier of the Widget Resource\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @key id: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * Weight of the widget\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  weight: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * Color of the widget;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  color: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"red\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" | \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"blue\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   * Nickname of the Widget resource\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n+  @added(Versions.v3Preview) nickname: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_qa\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_2025_08_29.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Creating stable API version with select properties omitted?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Creating stable API version with select properties omitted?\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n# typespec_2025_08_29.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Creating stable API version with select properties omitted?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## question\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIs it possible on typeSpec to add a new preview with some new parameters and a new stable for all other properties that we already have?

How do we handle a property that is in multiple preview versions, but we want to keep out of stable versions? \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor a practical example, we have the faultSimulation apis in our spec in 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview. If I mark 2025-07-01-preview with @previewVersion and faultSimulation with @added(versions.v2025_07_01_preview), the generation removes it from the previous preview specs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLlBIPHLFByb2ZpbNR5cmVtb3bce%2FQAm%2FABm8UoZW5jb2RlKCJiYXNlNjR1cmwixBdwxno%2FOiBieXRlc%2BkAklRoZSBzdGF0dXPkAJV0aGUgbGFzdCDkAS9hdGlvbuUE4CAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAkphZMddxCDlBW9TdGF0xGflAhXMFOkBssRzzDLlAIDlARRh6QI%2FxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQDHNFU5QHO5gFk6QNcxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QaJ6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBuHHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QRn6QPh5AMh6QHK6QPjTW92ZVLHFegD3MRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA5rLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBPXmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AgAT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYIwi7LKXt9CuUInsgjyhvLWegAzeYFHWdldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFeiDnAntPcuUCp%2BUB1ssvQ8cdUmVwbGFjZUFzeW5jzj%2FlAvfIN0N1c3RvbVBhdGNoU8QqCiAgIOkAkyzFDvYA50ZvdW7kAybkBQ7IHOYAkU3kAYTGSdBLyhDqBhTFGT4KICDlAJ3mAprvANTlApdlV2l0aG91dE9r8wDUbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3JpcOUCecY7xjPMGcw56AbKIHNhbXBs6wNmYWPFRHRoYXTmAmPpBm10byBkaWZmZeQAhO8C5sUp7gCyQcVI5QGWyHcs7ANxyA3mAujzAJJIRUFE6gZMxH5jaGVja%2BoAqmV4aXN0ZW7mCDAgxh5FyRTvAljNHe4ICw%3D%3D\\\\\\\\u0026e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest\\\\\\\\u0026vs=%7B%7D) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2021-10-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2024-10-01 version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2024-10-01`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2024-10-01`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource\\\\\\\\u003cEmployeeProperties\\\\\\\\u003e {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...ResourceNameParameter\\\\\\\\u003cEmployee\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Age of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  age?: int32;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** City of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  city?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** Profile of employee */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @removed(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @added(Versions.`2025-07-01-preview`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @encode(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"base64url\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  profile?: bytes;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  /** The status of the last operation. */\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningState?: ProvisioningState;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nshowing two propertties (EmployeeProperties.age and EmployeeProperties.profile) that use versioning.

Perhaps you deleted a version from your TypeSpec, but didn't delete the associated swaggers?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWe want to keep both old and new api versoins. What is the suggestion here? Do you suggest to create different TSP file for each version/use versioning in existing TSP?  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf second case, can you share some example where APIs/Properties are added/removed in a newer version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe idea behind TypeSpec versioning is to model the diffs in your API, encouraging best practices for API evolution. If you have questions about modeling particular changes, feel free to ask.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAbout your concern: fixing a new validation causing changes to older APIs\\\\u2014this usually happens when new changes are added without using the appropriate version decorators. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you added properties or made a property optional, but didn\\\\u2019t annotate them with @added or @madeOptional, then they would apply to all versions by default, including older ones.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s likely why your stable version (e.g., 2024-12-01) got unintentionally updated when you only meant to target 2025-07-01-preview.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo avoid this, always use decorators like @added and @madeOptional to indicate version-specific changes.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAs for the location field and the read/create mutability warning:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThat rule is a warning meant to be advisory. In your case, it doesn\\\\u2019t seem to apply\\\\u2014so this is a good example where you should not change the service behavior just to satisfy a linting rule. It's fine to ignore the warning here.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRegarding your question on renaming an API response (e.g., from MoveResponse to MoveResult):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the new name is meant for a specific version, ensure it\\\\u2019s versioned properly in your TypeSpec. In your repro, the naming appears correct\\\\u2014MoveResult in 2021-10-01-preview, and MoveResponse in 2024-10-01-preview\\\\u2014so it\\\\u2019s working as expected.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFinally, for adding or removing a parameter in only the new version:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, you can\\\\u2019t directly decorate a spread parameter. The best way is to use operation-specific parameters, which you can decorate with versioning decorators. You could alternatively decorate the core parameter definition (e.g., with an augment decorator), but that would affect every usage\\\\u2014so for localized changes, use operation-specific ones. Since this is a method parameter, the APIs are equivalent and the change has no SDK impact.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"static_typespec_to_swagger_mapping\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec-ARM-Decorators-Documentation.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"TypeSpec ARM Decorator Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# TypeSpec ARM Decorator Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n## 1. @armCommonTypesVersion\\\\\\\\n### Description\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec-ARM-Decorators-Documentation.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# TypeSpec ARM Decorator Mapping to Swagger Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. @armCommonTypesVersion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Description\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis decorator is used either on a namespace or a version enum value to indicate the version of the Azure Resource Manager common-types to use for refs in emitted Swagger files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**TypeSpec Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```typescript\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@typespec/versioning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Azure.ResourceManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing TypeSpec.Versioning;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armProviderNamespace\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ContosoProviderHubClient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Microsoft.ContosoProviderHub;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `2021-10-01-preview`,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Swagger Output:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"swagger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"info\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ContosoProviderHubClient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2021-10-01-preview\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"x-typespec-generated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"emitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    ]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"schemes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"host\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"management.azure.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"produces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"application/json\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"security\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure_auth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user_impersonation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      ]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"securityDefinitions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure_auth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"oauth2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Azure Active Directory OAuth2 Flow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"flow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"implicit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"authorizationUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"scopes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user_impersonation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"impersonate your user account\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  },\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"paths\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {},\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"definitions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {},\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"parameters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_azure_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"getstarted#azure-core#step09.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"9.

It is a best practice to add versioning support to your specification from the first version. To do that, you will need to define an `enum` containing your service versions and then apply the `@versioned` decorator to your service namespace.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere is an example for the `WidgetManager` service:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-08-31\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things to point out here:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We define an `enum` called `Versions` inside of the service namespace. For each service version, we map a version symbol like `v2022_08_31` to a version string like `2022-08-31`. This service currently only has a single version, but we can add more to this enum as things change over time.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We add the `@versioned` decorator and reference the `Versions` enum we defined using the fully-qualified name `Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions`. This marks the service as being versioned and specifies the set of versions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- We change the `@useDependency` decorator we used previously to now link each service version to a specific version of `Azure.Core`. See the [Using Azure.Core Versions](#using-azurecore-versions) section for more information.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nImagine that it's 3 months later and you want to release a new version of your service with some slight changes.

My team (Microsoft Translator) is trying to update our POST translate call with a breaking change.  The PR is: [Update translate call to 2025-05-01 by SG-MS \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #33410 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/33410) \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe old version (3.0) is being updated to a new version (2025-05-01-preview).  The big change to our typespec definition is that we will be moving most of the request properties from query parameters to the request body.  In 3.0, the only property in the request body was an array of InputTextItem.  InputTextItem is just a string.  All the other relevant data was passed in as query parameters. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn 2025-05-01-preview, we want to add a number of additional properties to the request body, so rather than the body consisting of InputTextItem, we want the body to contain a TranslateBody definition, which in turn contains all of our properties.  I'm not sure how to represent this in the tsp files in a compliant way.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOur translate operation in the routes.tsp file is \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop translate is CustomOperation\\\\\\\\u003c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n InputTextItem[],\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslateParameters,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n TranslationResult,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n ErrorResponse\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u003e; \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe first member of the template is the request body and I need it to be InputTextItem[] for 3.0 and I need it to be TranslateBody for 2025-05-01-preview.  Otherwise one of them will have the wrong set of arguments.  I considered simply updating InputTextItem to contain all the needed parameters in TranslateBody and then removing the unused ones with @added decorators, but the problem is we have a number of other operators in 2025-05-01-preview which use InputTextItem and require it to be just the text string.   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIs there anyway to have two different translate operations such that one is called by 3.0 and one is called by 2025-05-01-preview?

The recommended approach is to use the @added and @removed decorators to precisely control which versions a property appears in. \\\\n\\\\nHere's how it works:\\\\n- When you introduce a property in a preview version, use @added(Versions.<preview_version>). This will include the property in that preview and all subsequent versions unless you explicitly remove it.\\\\n- To exclude the property from a stable version, use @removed(Versions.<stable_version>). This will remove the property from the stable version and all subsequent versions, unless you add it back with another @added decorator in a later preview.\\\\n- If you want the property to appear in multiple preview versions but not in any stable version, you must use @added and @removed in combination for each version transition.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, suppose you have preview versions 2024-11-01-preview, 2025-03-01-preview, 2025-06-01-preview, and 2025-07-01-preview, and stable versions in between. You can do:\\\\n\\\\n```tsp\\\\nmodel MyResourceProperties {\\\\n  // Property appears in first preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2024_11_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_03_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property reappears in next preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_03_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_06_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property reappears in next preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_06_01_preview)\\\\n  @removed(Versions.v2025_07_01)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n\\\\n  // Property reappears in latest preview\\\\n  @added(Versions.v2025_07_01_preview)\\\\n  faultSimulation?: FaultSimulationType;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern ensures that faultSimulation is present only in the preview versions and omitted from all stable releases. However, this approach can be error-prone and verbose, so it's best to minimize the number of active preview versions. The official Azure policy is to have only one active preview version at a time, retiring older previews when a new one is introduced.\\\\n\\\\nYou can have multiple versions marked with @previewVersion, but only the latest preview should be active according to Azure guidelines. When you add a new preview, you should remove support for the previous preview soon after.\\\\n\\\\nFor more details and best practices, see the Azure TypeSpec versioning documentation and the example provided in the references.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"TypeSpec versioning works in the following way:\\\\nAll types in the spec are automatically part of the initial api-version\\\\nWhen a new api-version is introduced,  any new types `use@added(VERSION)` decorators to indicate they were added in that version, they are impliciutly included in every subsequent version\\\\nWhen a type does not appear in one version, then you use `@removed(VERSION)` to remove the type at that version, by default, it will not appear any subsequent versions.  It can be added back using `@added` [Here is a playground](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground/?options=%7B%22linterRuleSet%22%3A%7B%22extends%22%3A%5B%22%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-azure-rulesets%2Fresource-manager%22%5D%7D%7D&c=aW1wb3J0ICJAdHlwZXNwZWMvaHR0cCI7CtIZcmVzdNUZdmVyc2lvbmluZ8wfYXp1cmUtdG9vbHMvyCstxhVjb3Jl3yvIK3Jlc291cmNlLW1hbmFnZXIiOwoKdXNpbmcgSHR0cDvHDFJlc3TIDFbpAI7IEkHESi5Db3JlzhJSx1xNxls7CgovKiogQ29udG9zb8RUxR4gUHJvdmlkZXIg5gCDbWVudCBBUEkuICovCkBhcm3IIE5hbWVzcGFjZQpAc2VydmljZSgjeyB0aXRsZTogIsdXyC1IdWJDbGllbnQiIH0pCkDnAUNlZCjnAL9zKQpuyFAgTWljcm9zb2Z0LtJG7wC2QVBJIMdNc%2BQAoWVudW3oARNzIHsKICDELjIwMjEtMTAtMDEtcHJldmlld8g1xDQgIEB1c2VEZXBlbmRlbmN5KPUBLy7IVi52MV8wX1DGSF8xKcRAYXJtQ29tbW9uVOQBz8cq10jLKctUNcRIYPIAqWAsCuoAxTTGHP8Avf8Avf8Avf8Avf4AvecAoe0AtTUtMDf%2FAXr%2FAL3%2FAL3%2FAL3%2FAL3qAL3vAKlgLAp95gJtQegCb%2BsCiCDoA6rkAMhtb2RlbCBFbXBsb3llZSBpcyBUcmFja2Vk6ACCPMgcUHJvcGVydGllcz7lAp4uLukApuQDUFBhcmFtZXRlcskxPjvoAIbJX3DJRNJ8ymDpAv1BZ2Ugb2YgZcg%2F5gF4YWRk6wN%2BLuwBveQBEGFnZT86IGludDMyO%2BgBzENpdHnSSmNpdHk%2FOiBzdHLlBIPHLFByb2ZpbNR5cmVtb3bce%2FQAm%2FABm8UoZW5jb2RlKCJiYXNlNjR1cmwixBdwxno%2FOiBieXRlc%2BkAklRoZSBzdGF0dXPkAJV0aGUgbGFzdCDkAS9hdGlvbuUE4CAgQHZpc2liaWxpdHkoTGlmZWN5Y2zkAkphZMddxCDlBW9TdGF0xGflAhXMFOkBssRzzDLlAIDlARRh6QI%2FxXdAbHJvxDt1cwp1buQDHNFU5QHO5gFk6QNcxF%2FIRyBjcmXEJ3JlcXVlc3QgaGFzIGJlZW4gYWNjZXB0ZWTEZyAgQccOOiAiyAsi1lBpxEDkALTpAMHIROwAnDogIswP2kx1cGRhdMRPxUNVxw46ICLIC8o76QaJ6QDE5gDcZOcBolN1Y2NlZWTlAMXJDNM%2FxTbkAU1mYWlsyT5GxQ06ICLGCdw4d2FzIGNhbmNlyj5Dxw%2FkBuHHC%2F8BQCBkZWxl6QGARMQN5gD5yAsi6QRn6QPh5AMh6QHK6QPjTW92ZVLHFegD3MRzbW92xGhmcm9tIGxvY%2BYAvMVuxBPxA5rLM3RvzzF0b8ov9wCVc3BvbnPrBPXmAJbHFuwAl%2B4DbMU%2BxWTGfOYC7s1uaW50ZXJm5AgAT%2BgDlHMgZXh0ZW5kc%2FYIwi7LKXt9CuUInsgjyhvLWegAzeYFHWdldOQBp0HKNeQD5%2BwFeiDnAntPcuUCp%2BUB1ssvQ8cdUmVwbGFjZUFzeW5jzj%2FlAvfIN0N1c3RvbVBhdGNoU8QqCiAgIOkAkyzFDvYA50ZvdW7kAybkBQ7IHOYAkU3kAYTGSdBLyhDqBhTFGT4KICDlAJ3mAprvANTlApdlV2l0aG91dE9r8wDUbGlzdEJ5yDBHcm91cM9ETMUiUGFyZW501DxTdWJzY3JpcOUCecY7xjPMGcw56AbKIHNhbXBs6wNmYWPFRHRoYXTmAmPpBm10byBkaWZmZeQAhO8C5sUp7gCyQcVI5QGWyHcs7ANxyA3mAujzAJJIRUFE6gZMxH5jaGVja%2BoAqmV4aXN0ZW7mCDAgxh5FyRTvAljNHe4ICw%3D%3D&e=%40azure-tools%2Ftypespec-autorest&vs=%7B%7D)\\\\n```\\\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\\\nenum Versions {\\\\n/** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\\\n@useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\n`2021-10-01-preview`,\\\\n/** 2024-10-01 version */\\\\n@useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\n`2024-10-01`,\\\\n/** 2025-07-01-preview version */\\\\n@useDependency(Azure.ResourceManager.Versions.v1_0_Preview_1)\\\\n@armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\\\n`2025-07-01-preview`,\\\\n}\\\\n/** A ContosoProviderHub resource */\\\\nmodel Employee is TrackedResource<EmployeeProperties> {\\\\n...ResourceNameParameter<Employee>;\\\\n}\\\\n/** Employee properties */\\\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\\\n/** Age of employee */\\\\n@added(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\nage?: int32;\\\\n/** City of employee */\\\\ncity?: string;\\\\n/** Profile of employee */\\\\n@removed(Versions.`2024-10-01`)\\\\n@added(Versions.`2025-07-01-preview`)\\\\n@encode(\\\\\\\"base64url\\\\\\\")\\\\nprofile?: bytes;\\\\n/** The status of the last operation. */\\\\n@visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\\\nprovisioningState?: ProvisioningState;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\nshowing two propertties (EmployeeProperties.age and EmployeeProperties.profile) that use versioning.  'age' appears in the second, stable version and all subsequent versions,  'profile' appears in the first (preview) version, is removed in the stable version, and then added back again in the subsequent preview version.\\\\nNotably, this practice of adding a property at each preview version and removing it at each stable is easy to get wrong.\\\\nthe official Azure policy is to have only one active preview, as much as that is possible with api retention requirements.  So that, when you introduce a new preview version, the older preview is removed, ideally, this means that, especially when you just had a stable release, you remove support for the previous preview when (or soon after) you add the new preview version.\\\\nYou can see more details about versioning in typespec here: [Versioning | TypeSpec Azure](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/versioning/)\\\"}\"}]",
