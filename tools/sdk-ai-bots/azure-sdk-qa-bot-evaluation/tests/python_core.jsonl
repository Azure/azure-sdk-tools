(other than removing it from the pipeline...).", "ground_truth": "The \"black\" job in the Azure SDK for Python pipeline can fail for reasons beyond just code formatting. Even if running \"black\" locally with the same version (24.4.0) does not produce changes, there are a few areas to check for a root cause:\n1. Run Black with the Same Arguments as the Pipeline:The pipeline runs \"black\" using tox with specific arguments. Make sure you are running locally in the same way. From the official guidance, run: `tox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .` This ensures that the same config files, paths, and excludes are used. The pipeline may use a different configuration or target files that you are not formatting locally. Or you can tried the same command used by ci: `python -m azpysdk.main black --isolate sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects`.\n2. Check for Hidden Files or Config Differences: The pipeline uses the repository’s configuration, including pyproject.toml and any exclude/include patterns. Local runs may inadvertently skip files due to local ignore files, environment differences, or working directory mismatches. Double-check that your local environment matches the CI context.\n3. Run `git status` or `git diff` to find out whether there are files already formatted but not pushed to the pr.\n4. Line Endings and Whitespace: Sometimes, black fails due to line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) or invisible whitespace issues that are not flagged locally. Make sure your files have consistent line endings (prefer LF in repo).\n5. Check the Pipeline Log for Specific Files: Review the pipeline's failure log closely to see which files are reported as needing formatting. Sometimes, it’s a file outside your typical working set (such as generated code or test files).\n6. Reproduce in a Clean Environment: To eliminate local state issues, clone your repo in a fresh directory and re-run the pipeline’s black command as above. If you confirm that running \"black\" via tox in a clean environment with the same version does not report changes, but the pipeline still fails, check for possible pipeline caching or artifact issues.

You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\nHere are practical steps:\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\n```\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\nsphinx = false\n```", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "Getting started with TypeSpec server code generation for JavaScript", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/code-generation-javascript"}, {"title": "Getting started with TypeSpec server code generation for C#", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/code-generation-csharp"}, {"title": "Generate Swagger and TypeSpec in Package", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Generate-Swagger-and-TypeSpec-in-Package"}, {"title": "Prerequisites", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Dataplane-Codegen-Quick-Start"}, {"title": "Typespec Validation issue", "link": ""}, {"title": "TypeSpec SDK Generation - Getting Started", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/ai/typespec_generation.md"}, {"title": "How to properly update the TypeSpec environment?", "link": ""}, {"title": "Prerequisites", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Dataplane-Codegen-Quick-Start"}, {"title": "Getting Started with TypeSpec For REST APIs", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/01-setup-basic-syntax"}, {"title": "Getting started with TypeSpec migration", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/01-get-started"}, {"title": "Versioning", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started-rest/06-versioning"}, {"title": "Create or update an Azure REST API spec", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-specs"}, {"title": "TypeSpec Validation error", "link": ""}, {"title": "Use tools to create and validate Azure REST APIs specs", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-tooling"}, {"title": "Getting started with TypeSpec server code generation for C#", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/code-generation-csharp"}, {"title": "remove body for common op", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/breakingchange"}, {"title": "Adding Common Types to Azure Resource Manager (ARM)", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/arm/add-common-types"}, {"title": "TypeSpec SDK Generation - Getting Started", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/ai/typespec_generation.md"}, {"title": "Installation", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/introduction/installation"}, {"title": "Azure REST API, SDK development process with TypeSpec", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Azure-REST-API,-SDK-development-process-with-TypeSpec"}, {"title": "Style guide", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide"}, {"title": "Generated Types", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types"}, {"title": "Data types", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/data-types"}, {"title": "Documentation", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation"}, {"title": "Identifiers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/identifiers"}, {"title": "Decorators", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/decorators"}, {"title": "Documentation", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation"}, {"title": "Generated Types", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types"}, {"title": "Decorators", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/decorators"}, {"title": "Built-in Decorators", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/built-in-decorators"}], "expected_references": [{"title": "Documentation", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/documentation"}, {"title": "Generated Types - Client Documentation", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types"}, {"title": "Style guide", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/handbook/style-guide"}]}
