            "comment": "Here is a summary of the service described by this APIView:\n\nOverview  \nThis API provides a service for managing secrets within an Azure Key Vault. It supports operations for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, backing up, restoring, and listing secrets as well as their properties and versions.\n\nAPI Version  \nThe API includes an `ApiVersion` enumeration with multiple values; the latest version is `V7_6_PREVIEW_2`.\n\nKey Client Classes  \nThe synchronous `SecretClient` class exposes methods such as `backup_secret`, `begin_delete_secret`, `begin_recover_deleted_secret`, `close`, `get_deleted_secret`, `get_secret`, `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, `list_properties_of_secrets`, `purge_deleted_secret`, `restore_secret_backup`, `send_request`, `set_secret`, and `update_secret_properties`. Its asynchronous counterpart, `SecretClient` in the `azure.keyvault.secrets.aio` namespace, provides methods including `backup_secret`, `close`, `delete_secret`, `get_deleted_secret`, `get_secret`, `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, `list_properties_of_secrets`, `purge_deleted_secret`, `recover_deleted_secret`, `restore_secret_backup`, `send_request`, `set_secret`, and `update_secret_properties`.\n\nAdditional Classes  \nOther classes include `DeletedSecret`, which represents a deleted secret and offers initialization and representation methods; `KeyVaultSecret`, which models a secret along with its value and metadata; `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier`, used for identifying secrets within the vault; and `SecretProperties`, which encapsulates the metadata associated with a secret.\n\nFunctionality and Structure  \nThe API is structured to support both synchronous and asynchronous operations with context management and is instrumented with distributed tracing decorators. It also incorporates mechanisms for handling long-running operations and direct HTTP request handling, providing flexibility in managing the lifecycle of secrets in a cloud environment.",
