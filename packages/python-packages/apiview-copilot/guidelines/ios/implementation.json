Implementation code can be made internal or file-private and placed within the same source file as the consuming code.\n\nService clients are the main starting points for developers calling Azure services with the Azure SDK. Each client library should have at least one client, so it\u2019s easy to discover. The guidelines in this section describe patterns for the design of a service client. Because for iOS only asynchronous service clients are required, the sections below are organized into general service client guidance.\n\nService methods are the methods on the client that invoke operations on the service.\n\nThe Azure SDK team has provided an AzureCore library that contains common mechanisms for cross cutting concerns such as configuration and doing HTTP requests."
