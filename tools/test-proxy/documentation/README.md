# Test Proxy Documentation

This folder contains documentation relevant to the Azure-SDK test-proxy package.

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| asset-sync | Primary location for `asset-sync` documentation. |
| explore-wiremock | Before investing in our own implementation, we investigated the closest other existing solution. It definitely doesn't have the same use-case, but the write-up remains! |
| test-proxy | While the primary readme is present [in the test-proxy project folder](../Azure.Sdk.Tools.TestProxy/README.md), this folder contains additional docs. |
