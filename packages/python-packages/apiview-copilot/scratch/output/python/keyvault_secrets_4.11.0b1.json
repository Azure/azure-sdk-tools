            "comment": "### API Summary\n\n**Purpose**  \nThis API is designed to securely manage secret information within Azure Key Vault. It provides capabilities to perform CRUD operations on secrets, including creation, retrieval, update, deletion, backup, restore, and recovery, as well as operations for securely rolling and listing secrets. The service facilitates seamless integration with secure credential-based access for managing sensitive data.\n\n**API Version**  \nThe API defines an `ApiVersion` enumeration to support multiple versions. The most recent version available is `V7_7_preview_1`, reflecting the latest improvements and features in the service.\n\n**Client Classes**  \nArchitects will be primarily interested in the `SecretClient` classes. The API offers a synchronous `SecretClient` in the main namespace as well as an asynchronous `SecretClient` in the `azure.keyvault.secrets.aio` namespace. Both client classes cover the same broad range of secret management functionality while catering to different execution models.\n\n**Functional Overview**  \nThe serviceâ€™s client methods enable comprehensive management of secrets, supporting fundamental CRUD operations and advanced features such as secret backup, restoration, deletion, recovery, and rolling updates. Additionally, the clients include functionality to list secret properties and versions, and allow for lower-level HTTP request handling to extend or customize operations. These capabilities ensure a robust and flexible approach to managing secret data within secure environments.",
