Missing x-ms-discriminator-value and presence of discriminator:\nYes, this is by design. The TypeSpec emitter uses the standard OpenAPI 3 discriminator property, not the Azure-specific x-ms-discriminator-value. The @discriminator decorator in TypeSpec results in the discriminator field in the generated OpenAPI, as per the latest OpenAPI and Azure SDK standards. This approach provides better compatibility with code generators and client SDKs. The use of x-ms-discriminator-value is not needed when the discriminator field is present and correctly configured.\nSee the TypeSpec documentation and Azure guidelines for more.\n2. Duplicate objectType property in generated Swagger:\nThis is a known limitation of how inheritance and discriminator are currently handled in TypeSpec to OpenAPI conversion. If both the base (AzureBackupRestoreRequest) and the derived model (AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest) define the objectType property, OpenAPI will reflect both in the derived model, leading to apparent duplication.\nThis does not cause functional issues, but it can be confusing. The current best practice is to only define the discriminator property (objectType) in the base model and set its value in the derived models, rather than redefining the property. In TypeSpec, this would look like:\n```\n@discriminator(\"objectType\")\nmodel AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: string;\n// ... other properties ...\n}\nmodel AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest extends AzureBackupRestoreRequest {\nobjectType: \"AzureBackupRecoveryPointBasedRestoreRequest\";\nrecoveryPointId: string;\n}\n```\nThis way, the objectType property is only defined in the base model, and the derived model just sets its value. This should prevent duplication in the emitted Swagger.\nAction Items:\nRefactor your TypeSpec so that only the base model defines the discriminator property (objectType), and the derived models assign its value.\nDo not worry about x-ms-discriminator-value not being present: it is not required when the standard discriminator property is used.", "expected_knowledges": [{"title": "Understanding the OpenAPI Changes", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/mustread"}, {"title": "How to create an Example for a typespec model?", "link": ""}, {"title": "Convert OpenAPI specs to TypeSpec", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-typespec-conversion"}, {"title": "`@typespec/*`", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Dependencies"}, {"title": "Changing Property to Optional with Default", "link": ""}, {"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "Guideline for Client Emitter", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/guideline"}, {"title": "OpenAPI3 to TypeSpec", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/openapi3/cli"}, {"title": "What is OpenAPI?", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-openapi"}, {"title": "Generated Types", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/howtos/generate-client-libraries/08types"}, {"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "TypeSpec Validation error", "link": ""}, {"title": "Operations", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/http/operations"}, {"title": "", "link": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff-for-TypeSpec"}, {"title": "Is it possible to make a field to be optional only on new api version?", "link": ""}, {"title": "Introduction", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/intro"}, {"title": "Microsoft Azure REST API Guidelines", "link": "https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/Guidelines.md"}, {"title": "Duplicate model definition errors on compilation with TypeSpec Compiler v1.0.0 - Microsoft.Mission", "link": ""}, {"title": "spread-discriminated-model", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/spread-discriminated-model"}, {"title": "Does TypeSpec have the option to achieve mutually exclusive?", "link": ""}, {"title": "What is OpenAPI?", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-openapi"}, {"title": "Use tools to create and validate Azure REST APIs specs", "link": "https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs/api-tooling"}], "expected_references": [{"title": "Microsoft Azure REST API Guidelines", "link": "https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/Guidelines.md"}, {"title": "TypeSpec for OpenAPI Developers", "link": "https://typespec.io/docs/getting-started/typespec-for-openapi-dev"}, {"title": "spread-discriminated-model", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/spread-discriminated-model"}, {"title": "Understanding the OpenAPI Changes", "link": "https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/migrate-swagger/faq/mustread"}]}
