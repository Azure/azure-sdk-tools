# Checklist for creating a new repo

The following are some helpful steps and ideas to consider when you are creating a new repository from this template. Some of the ideas may be good ideas for repos generally.

We will eventually break this checklist into meaningful sections.

- [ ] Provide a concise and accurate description of your project in the GitHub "description" field.
- [ ] Provide a meaningful URL for your project, as appropriate. For .NET Core projects, this should be "https://github.com/dotnet/core".
- [ ] Update all of the README.md files to be specific to your project, taking care to replace all of the "New Repo" strings.
- [ ] The contributing link in CONTRIBUTING.md is a good choice for .NET Core projects. Update as appropriate.
- [ ] Delete the entry in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES - it is there solely as an example
- [ ] Delete CHECKLIST.md
