  1. DO NOT make comments that don't actually identify a problem
  2. DO NOT comment on lack of documentation comments
  3. DO NOT suggest changes to the implementation or structure of code annotated with the @Generated annotation. You MAY still flag naming issues (e.g. casing, typos) or API design concerns (e.g. too many parameters) on @Generated methods, since those are fixed in the TypeSpec source.
  4. DO NOT suggest enforcing consistency in naming conventions for enums
  5. DO NOT complain about hardcoding dependency versions in the POM.
  6. DO NOT comment on methods or overrides lacking an implementation.
  7. DO NOT recommend annotating parameters to express nullability expectations.
