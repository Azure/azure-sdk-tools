{"testcase": "Playground usage", "query": "title: Playground usage\n\nquestion: Hi,\nQuestion on usage of the playground at https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/playground . When we are putting together something to use as an example for a new addition of a child proxy resource to our spec we get import errors. This is because we are importing from a common model files.\nIs it possible to add files or somehow scope a playground so its context is our existing specification so it imports the references correctly.  For example our spec is in \\specification\\netapp\\resource-manager\\Microsoft.NetApp\\NetApp that includes models.tsp file.\nCan we create a playground that would resolve something like import \"./../models.tsp\";", "ground_truth": "There is no a 'remote import' feature in the typespec azure playground.", "context": "", "response_length": 71}
{"testcase": "What decorator should be used in this case?", "query": "title: What decorator should be used in this case?\n\nquestion: Hi team,\nIn version v2, we introduced a new model model2 and updated featureA (originally added in v1) to use model2 as its parameter. In v1, featureA used model1 at the same position.\nHere’s the setup I tried (using @typeChangedFrom):\n```\n@added(v1)\nmodel1;\n@added(v2)\nmodel2;\n@added(v1)\nfeatureA {\n@typeChangedFrom(v1, model1)\nbody: model2;\n}\n```\nHowever, this shows the error: \"model2 does not exist in v1\".\nWhat would be the correct decorator to use in this situation?\nThank you!", "ground_truth": "it should be `typedChangedFrom(v2, model1)` here otherwise you are saying in v1 you changed from using model1 to model2 which then of course doesn't exists", "context": "", "response_length": 155}

{"testcase": "Service under conversation label", "query": "title: Service under conversation label\n\nquestion: My team currently has a PR open to release a new stable API. However, due to backend delays, it’s been open since July. During that time, the [typespec migration PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36556) was drafted against our preview API. Now, the service-under-conversion label has been added to our stable PR.

As such, they have the Azure linting in place (naming conventions and whatnot).\nWe wanted to know whether definitions can also come with suppressions (not inline, as this definition is auto-importer on a regular basis), which would apply ONLY to the definitions we share, not to the rest of the consumer's project?\nThanks!", "ground_truth": "suppression can only be provided inline for now.
