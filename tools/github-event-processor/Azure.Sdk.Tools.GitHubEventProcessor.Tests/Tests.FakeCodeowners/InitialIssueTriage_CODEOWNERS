# FAKE Codeowners file for InitialIssueTriage testing. Each metadata block has a unique ServiceLabel for
# testing different scenarios. The ServiceLabel needs to be returned from the AI Label service mock in order
# for a particular block to be selected.
# Note: FakeUser1 is the owner that opened the issue in the 
# Tests.JsonEventPayloads/InitialIssueTriage_issue_opened_no_labels_no_assignee.json file.

# This scenario is a ServiceOwners block with no AzureSdkOwners
# ServiceLabel: %FakeLabel1
# ServiceOwners: @FakeUser7 @FakeUser8

# The scenarios here are a ServiceOwners block with a single AzureSdkOwner.
# The first scenario will be that the AzureSdkOwner doesn't have issue assignment permissions
# and the ServiceAttention rule is turned off. The ServiceLabel and NeedsTeamTriage will be added to the issue.
# The second scenario will be that the AzureSdkOwner doesn't have issue assignment permissions
# meaning that the ServiceOwners/ServiceAttention fallback will be executed.
# The third scenario will be that the AzureSdkOwner has issue assignment permissions. This
# will cause the owner to be assigned to the issue without a comment mentioning all AzureSdkOwners
# ServiceLabel: %FakeLabel2
# ServiceOwners: @FakeUser0 @FakeUser9
# AzureSdkOwners: @FakeUser1

# The scenarios here are a ServiceOwners block with a multiple AzureSdkOwners.
# The first scenario is that none of the AzureSdkOwners will have issue assignment permissions
# meaning that the ServiceOwners/ServiceAttention fallback will be executed.
# The second scenario is that only 1 of the AzureSdkOwners will have issue assignment permissions.
# This will cause the owner with permissions to be assigned to the issue and both owners will be
# in the at mention.
# ServiceOwners block with multiple AzureSdkOwners
# ServiceLabel: %FakeLabel3
# ServiceOwners: @FakeUser3 @FakeUser4
# AzureSdkOwners: @FakeUser1 @FakeUser5

# AzureSdkOwners and ServiceOwners pulled from source path/owners.

# The second scenario will test both AzureSdkOwners not having issue assignment permission
