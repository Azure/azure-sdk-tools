The secret rotation tool provides configuration driven orchestration of secret origination, propagation, revocation and metadata storage.

If the tool's installed locally, it's invoked like:

```
dotnet tool run secrets --help
```

If the tool's installed globally, it's invoked like:

```
secrets --help
```
