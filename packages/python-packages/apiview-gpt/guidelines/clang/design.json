These are always avoidable by the direct caller, and will always require a source code change (by the caller) to fix.\nPost-Conditions\n: Post-Condition violations happen when some function didn't do the correct thing, these are always bugs in the function itself, and users shouldn't be expected to handle them.\nExhaustion / Act of God\n: errors like running out of stack space, or dealing with power failure that, in general, can not be anticipated and after which it may be hard to execute any more code, let alone recover. Code handling these errors needs to be written to very specific requirements, for example not doing any allocations and never growing the stack.\nRecoverable Error\n: Things like trying to open a file that doesn't exist, or trying to write to a full disk. These kinds of errors can usually be handled by a function's caller directly, and need to be considered by callers that want to be robust."

If you need to allocate memory of a dynamic (user specified) size, or of an extremely large size, then failures of that allocation should always be treated as a recoverable error. However, for small, compile-time constant sized allocations the decision of weather to treat a failure as an \"Act of God\" or a \"Recoverable error\" is more subtle and should be decided when you start a new library (with Architectural Review Board consultation).\n\nOn some platforms, mainly those that overcommit, it's extremely hard to handle OOM gracefully. Additionally, if you are \"almost\" out of memory and attempt to grow the stack - by calling functions, for example - then the system MIGHT NOT TELL YOU and your program's state will be corrupted. To recover from out of memory errors the program must have bounded stack size and must set the stack size to that bound at the start of the program.

The recipient of a value is the caller for [callee allocates] parameters and the callee for [caller allocates] parameters\n[transfer none]\n: indicates no change in ownership for this parameter. This is sometimes called \"borrowing\"\n[transfer full]\n: indicates complete ownership transfer. After a call to the function the recipient (either the caller or the callee) will be\nresponsible for the value. This usually means the recipient will at least need to arrange for any memory referred to by\nthe value to be freed.\n[transfer container]\n: indicates full ownership transfer for a container value, but not for its contents. For example a char** parameter (that referrers to an array of cstrings)\nwould be annotated as [transfer container] if the recipient is expected to free the array, but not free each element therein.\n[nullable]\n: the parameter may be set to NULL, only valid for pointer parameters/return values. Don't annotate return values or out parameters as [nullable]\nif NULL is used to report errors. If a parameter is marked [nullable] document what happens when it is null.\n[not nullable]\n: The parameter may not be null.\n[caller allocates]\n: memory for the value is expected to be allocated by the caller. This is the default for [in] parameters, and [out]/[in,out] parameters\nthat have a single indirection (that is Foo* p is [caller allocates] but Foo** p is not).\n[callee allocates]\n: memory for the value will be allocated by the callee. This usually means the caller will need to free said memory when it's no longer needed.\n\nFor example:\n{% highlight c %}\n/**\n@brief execute a blocking get request\n\n@memberof az_appconf_client\n\n@param[in] client [transfer none]\n@param[in] path_and_query [transfer none][not nullable]\n\n \t  The query to execute relative to the base url of the client\n\n\n@param[out] result [transfer full][not nullable][callee allocates]\n@param[out] result_sz [not nullable] size of the result\n/\naz_appconf_err az_appconf_req_get(\naz_appconf_client client, const char* path_and_query, unsigned char** result, size_t* result_sz);\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n<code> \t  The query to execute relative to the base url of the client\n</code>\n\nHere we see that the first two parameters are input parameters, with no ownership transfer (that is, they are a \"borrow\"). The result output parameter is labeled as [callee allocates] because it allocates memory for the output parameter itself. Since result is owned by the caller after az_appconf_req_get returns it's annotated as [transfer full].\n\nThe annotations do not require any special doxygen support and are simply convention.\n\n{% include requirement/MAY id=\"clang-docs-doxygen-defaults \" %} assume the following default annotations:\n[not nullable]\nFor [out] and [in,out] pointer parameters: [caller allocates][transfer none]\nFor [out] and [in,out] pointer-to-pointer parameters: [callee allocates][transfer full]\nfor [in] parameters: [caller allocates] (Note: [callee allocates] doesn't make sense for [in] parameters)"
