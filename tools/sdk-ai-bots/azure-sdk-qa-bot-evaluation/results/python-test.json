            "answer": "The error you are seeing (`SSLCertVerificationError: certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate`) occurs because your async live tests are trying to connect to the test proxy at `https://localhost:5001`, but the SSL certificate used by the test proxy is self-signed and not trusted by default. This is a known issue for async tests in the Azure SDK Python repo when using HTTPS for the test proxy.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this:\n1. **Update your branch to latest main**: The test proxy's certificate is periodically rotated and automatically configured during proxy startup. First, make sure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from `main`.\n2. **Unset the `PROXY_URL` environment variable**: If updating doesn't resolve the issue, unset the `PROXY_URL` environment variable to default to HTTP (`http://localhost:5000`), which doesn't require certificate verification. This will allow your async tests to run without the SSL error.\n   - You can do this by removing or commenting out the line that sets `PROXY_URL` to `https://localhost:5001` in your environment or CI config.\n3. **If you require HTTPS**: If your tests or service specifically require HTTPS for the proxy, and you continue to encounter SSL errors after updating, reach out to the Azure SDK team for assistance with certificate setup for async environments, as async tests may exhibit inconsistent behavior with SSL verification.\n\n**Summary:** For most cases, running the test proxy over HTTP (`http://localhost:5000`) will resolve the issue. Only use HTTPS if you have a specific need and have coordinated certificate trust for your test environment.\n\nFor more details and troubleshooting steps, see the official guide below.",

This is a common issue when your TypeSpec project uses relative imports to shared files located in sibling or parent directories.\n\nTo resolve this in the SDK generation pipeline, you need to update your per-project setup by configuring the `tsp-location.yaml` file to include all required directories using the `additionalDirectories` property. This ensures that the TypeSpec compiler can access not only your main directory, but also any additional folders needed for imports.\n\n**How to fix:**\n1. Locate or create a `tsp-location.yaml` file under your SDK package directory (e.g., `sdk/discovery-workspace/azure-discovery-workspace/tsp-location.yaml`).\n2. Specify the main directory and all additional directories needed for compilation, like so:\n\n```yaml\ndirectory: specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Workspace\ncommit: <your_commit_sha>\nrepo: Azure/azure-rest-api-specs\nadditionalDirectories:\n  - specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Shared\n```\n\nThis tells the pipeline to sync both your service folder and the shared folder before compiling.

Double-check that all files intended to be checked by black are included locally.\n   - Ensure there are no unstaged changes, CRLF vs LF line ending inconsistencies, or other subtle differences (see [test proxy troubleshooting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/test_proxy_troubleshooting.md) for line break issues).\n\n3. **Check the Pipeline Log for Details:**\n   - The CI pipeline log for the 'black' job will indicate which file(s) failed the check and the nature of the formatting difference. Look for error messages or file paths in the log output.\n\n4. **Sync Your Local Environment:**\n   - Make sure your repo is fully up-to-date and clean (e.g., run `git clean -xfd` and `git reset --hard origin/branch`).\n   - If there are any pre-commit hooks or additional formatting tools, disable them to avoid conflicts.\n\n5. **Run Black in CI Mode Locally:**\n   - Use the exact tox invocation:\n     ```\n     tox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .\n     ```\n     This will ensure black is run exactly as it is in CI.\n\nIf after following these steps the issue persists, share the specific error message from the pipeline log with the Python SDK team.

            "answer": "The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\nHere are practical steps:\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\n```\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\nsphinx = false\n```",

            "answer": "The Python docstring errors during Sphinx build are caused by malformed or unstructured comments and documentation in your TypeSpec definitions. The TypeSpec Python emitter converts doc comments and type definitions into Python docstrings, which must be valid reStructuredText (reST) for Sphinx to parse them without errors. The most common causes for these errors are:\n\n1. **Malformed lists and indentation in TypeSpec doc comments**: Bullet lists, definition lists, or block quotes in TypeSpec doc comments that do not follow reST formatting rules (e.g., missing blank lines before/after lists, improper indentation, or inconsistent use of colons) will result in Sphinx warnings/errors like \"unexpected unindent\" or \"unexpected indentation\".\n2. **Duplicate explicit targets**: Using repeated explicit links (e.g., `.. _learn more:`) within a docstring will trigger Sphinx duplicate target warnings.\n3. **Inline unions**: For the `ServiceTier` union and the `conversation: { id: string; } | null` in `Response`, you should avoid inline union expressions and always use named unions/models, per Azure TypeSpec guidance ([no-unnamed-union](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/azure-core/rules/no-unnamed-union)). Inline unions may also produce docstring output that Sphinx cannot reliably parse.\n\n**Concrete steps to resolve the issues:**\n\nA. **Doc comment hygiene**\n- Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments use valid reST formatting:\n  - Bullet lists: Each item should be preceded by a blank line and aligned with consistent indentation. End the list with a blank line.\n  - Block quotes: End block quotes with a blank line.\n  - Definition lists: Separate items with blank lines.\n- Avoid repeated explicit targets in links (e.g., avoid duplicating `.. _learn more:`).\n- Avoid any non-reST formatting in comments (including Markdown-only features).\n\nB. **Avoid inline union expressions**\n- For the `conversation` property in `Response`, instead of `{ id: string; } | null`, define a named model for the conversation object and use a named union for `ConversationOrNone`:\n  ```typespec\n  model Conversation {\n    id: string;\n  }\n  union ConversationOrNone {\n    Conversation,\n    null,\n  }\n  model Response {\n    ...Response_Pre_Update;\n    conversation: ConversationOrNone;\n  }\n  ```\n  This improves code generation and documentation consistency.\n\n- For `ServiceTier`, your union is correctly named, but ensure that any doc comments for the union or its members use valid reST (not Markdown). For example:\n  ```typespec\n  /**\n   * Represents the available service tiers.\n   *\n   * - auto: Automatically selected tier\n   * - default: Default tier\n   * - flex: Flexible tier\n   * - scale: Scalable tier\n   * - priority: Priority tier\n   */\n  union ServiceTier {\n    \"auto\",\n    \"default\",\n    \"flex\",\n    \"scale\",\n    \"priority\",\n  }\n  ```\n  - Add a blank line before the bullet list, ensure consistent indentation, and avoid trailing commas in comments.\n\nC. **General docstring formatting tips**\n- Only use reST features supported by Sphinx in doc comments. Avoid Markdown-only syntax.\n- Always end lists and blocks with blank lines in comments.\n- For definition lists, use the reST syntax:\n  ```\n  term\n    definition\n  ```\n\n**Summary**: Review and update your TypeSpec comments and type definitions to use only valid reST syntax, avoid inline unions, and provide clear, blank-line-separated doc comments. This will prevent malformed docstrings and eliminate Sphinx warnings/errors during documentation build.\n\nIf you have further errors, review the generated Python docstrings and compare with reST formatting rules, then adjust the corresponding TypeSpec comments.\n",
