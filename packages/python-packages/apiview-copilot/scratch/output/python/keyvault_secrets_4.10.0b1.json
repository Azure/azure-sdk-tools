            "comment": "Here is a summary of the service described by this APIView:\n\nPurpose  \nThis API provides functionality for managing secrets in an Azure KeyVault context. It supports operations such as setting, retrieving, backing up, deleting, recovering, purging, and updating secrets. It also includes capabilities for listing secret properties and versions as well as sending custom HTTP requests. Both synchronous and asynchronous interactions are supported.\n\nAPI Version  \nThe API version is defined by an enum named `ApiVersion`. The latest version listed is `7.6-preview.2`.\n\nClient Classes  \nThe synchronous client class, `SecretClient`, includes the following methods: `backup_secret`, `begin_delete_secret`, `begin_recover_deleted_secret`, `close`, `get_deleted_secret`, `get_secret`, `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, `list_properties_of_secrets`, `purge_deleted_secret`, `restore_secret_backup`, `send_request`, `set_secret`, and `update_secret_properties`. The asynchronous client class, also named `SecretClient` within the `azure.keyvault.secrets.aio` namespace, offers these methods: `backup_secret`, `close`, `delete_secret`, `get_deleted_secret`, `get_secret`, `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, `list_properties_of_secrets`, `purge_deleted_secret`, `recover_deleted_secret`, `restore_secret_backup`, `send_request`, `set_secret`, and `update_secret_properties`.\n\nOther Classes  \nAdditional classes in this API include `DeletedSecret`, `KeyVaultSecret`, `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier`, and `SecretProperties`. These classes define the data models for handling secret information and their associated metadata within the service.",
