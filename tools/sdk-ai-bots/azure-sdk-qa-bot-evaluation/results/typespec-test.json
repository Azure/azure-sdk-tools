If not can you share the limitations?\nHere is the pattern we are trying to implement:\n- Length - 4 - 64\n- Alphanumerics and hyphens\n- Can't end with period. Start with a letter\n- Can't start or end with hyphen. Can't us consecutive hyphens\n- Can have spaces but not at the start or end of a name.\n```\nmodel StorageDiscoveryScope {\n@doc(\"Display name of the collection\")\n@pattern(\"^(?! )[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:[ -][a-zA-Z0-9]+)*(?<! )$\")\n@minLength(4)\n@maxLength(64)\ndisplayName: string;\n```",
