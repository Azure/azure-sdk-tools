This typically happens when you set the PROXY_URL to use HTTPS (e.g., 'https://localhost:5001').\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this issue:\\\\n1. **Update your branch to the latest main**: The test proxy's certificate is periodically rotated. Make sure your branch includes the latest changes from main to get the current certificate version.\\\\n2. **Async environment caveat**: Even with the latest certificate, async tests may still fail nondeterministically due to environment-specific issues with certificate trust.\\\\n3. **Workaround**: If you do not specifically require HTTPS for the proxy endpoint, unset the PROXY_URL environment variable or set it to use HTTP (e.g., 'http://localhost:5000'). The HTTP endpoint does not require certificate verification and should work for most test scenarios.\\\\n4. **If HTTPS is required**: If your tests must use HTTPS, and updating the branch does not resolve the issue, you may need to reach out to the Azure SDK team for further assistance, as async environments can have persistent SSL trust issues.\\\\n\\\\nSummary: For most cases, switching to the HTTP proxy endpoint will resolve the SSL certificate verification error for async live tests. Only use HTTPS if absolutely necessary, and ensure your environment trusts the test proxy's certificate.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You're encountering an SSL certificate error when running live tests for async APIs, specifically when connecting to https://localhost:5001.

If you also want to record, avoid setting AZURE_SKIP_LIVE_RECORDING. As a workaround for the SSL issue, set the environment variable PROXY_URL to http://localhost:5000 instead of using HTTPS.

Go to [Azure DevOps - Azure SDK Internal Project](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build)\n2. Search for the pipeline named `python - resource` or similar, as the pipeline is named according to the service directory for management SDKs.\n3. The direct link format for a service pipeline is: `https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=<ID>&_a=summary`\n- You can search for `resource` in the pipelines list to locate the exact one.",

            "answer": "Your pipeline is failing due to unresolved relative imports in your TypeSpec files (e.g., '../Discovery.Shared/namespace.tsp'). This is a common issue when TypeSpec files import resources from directories outside the main service folder. To resolve these 'import-not-found' errors, you need to explicitly tell the TypeSpec compiler where to find these additional directories.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Open your `tspconfig.yaml` file located in your service's TypeSpec directory (e.g., `specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Workspace/tspconfig.yaml`).\n2. Add an `additionalDirectories` array to your configuration, listing the relative paths to all folders containing imported `.tsp` files. For your case, you should add the path to `Discovery.Shared`.\n\nExample:\n```yaml\nadditionalDirectories:\n  - ../Discovery.Shared\n```\n\nMake sure the path is relative to the location of your `tspconfig.yaml` file. This will allow the TypeSpec compiler to resolve imports like '../Discovery.Shared/namespace.tsp'.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Update `tspconfig.yaml` as shown above.\n- Re-run your pipeline or TypeSpec compilation.\n- The import errors should be resolved if the paths are correct and the referenced files exist.\n\nIf you have multiple shared folders, add each one to the `additionalDirectories` array.\n\n**Reference:** This is the recommended fix for `import-not-found` errors in TypeSpec SDK generation for Azure services.",

Configuration\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n# handbook#configuration#configuration.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Configuration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Configuration file\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration can be provided via the `tspconfig.yaml` configuration file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec compiler will look for the closest `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the same directory or closest parent directory from the TypeSpec entrypoint.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor example if running `tsp compile /dev/foo/bar/main.tsp`, the compiler will lookup the file at the folllowing paths (in order):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/bar/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/foo/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/dev/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `/tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Schema\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe file is a `yaml` document with the following structure. See the [next section](#typespec-configuration-options) for details on each option.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel TypeSpecProjectSchema {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  parameters?: Record\\\\\\\\u003c{default: string}\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `environment-variables`?: Record\\\\\\\\u003c{default: string}\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `warn-as-error`?: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `output-dir`?: string;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `trace`?: string | string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  imports?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emit?: string[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `dry-run`?: boolean;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  options?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cunknown\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  linter?: LinterConfig;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel LinterConfig {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  extends?: RuleRef[];\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  enable?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cRuleRef, boolean\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  disable?: Record\\\\\\\\u003cRuleRef, string\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Extending Project Files\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere may be instances where you want to build different folders with varying options (such as different emitters), but still want to share some common configurations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, you can use the `extends` property in the configuration file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, in `\\\\\\\\u003cmy-pkg\\\\\\\\u003e/tspconfig.yaml`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    some-option: my-name\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    some-other-option: This is a title\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nin `\\\\\\\\u003cmy-pkg\\\\\\\\u003e/proj2/tspconfig.yaml`, enable `emitter1` using the options specified in the parent `tspconfig.yaml`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=proj2/tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### What gets extended\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe extending logic follows these rules:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Root-level properties**: Shallow merge for all properties except `options`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Options property**: Deep merge at one level (per emitter)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Override behavior**: Properties specified in the extending file will completely override those from the extended file\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Root-level merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen extending a configuration, most properties (like `emit`, `imports`, `trace`, etc.) are merged at the root level. If the same property exists in both files, the extending file's value completely replaces the extended file's value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Options merge behavior:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `options` property receives special treatment with a one-level deep merge:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Different emitters from both files are combined\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- If the same emitter is configured in both files, the extending file's emitter configuration completely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ncompletely overrides the extended file's configuration for that emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Individual emitter options are not merged - it's all or nothing per emitter\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Base config (parent/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter1\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-a: value-a\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-b: value-b\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter2:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-x: value-x\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Extending config (child/tspconfig.yaml)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nextends: ../tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  - emitter3  # Completely replaces the emit array\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter1:   # Completely replaces emitter1 options\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-c: value-c\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  emitter3:   # Added alongside emitter2 from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    option-y: value-y\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Resulting merged config:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// emit: [emitter3]  # Only emitter3, emitter1 is gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// options:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter1: { option-c: value-c }  # Only option-c, option-a and option-b are gone\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter2: { option-x: value-x }  # Inherited from parent\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n//   emitter3: { option-y: value-y }  # From extending config\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Variable interpolation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe TypeSpec project file provides variable interpolation using:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- config file parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- emitter options can reference each other\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nVariable interpolation is done using an variable expression surrounded by `{` and `}`. (`{\\\\\\\\u003cexpression\\\\\\\\u003e}`)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nExamples:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `{output-dir}/my-path`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- `{env.SHARED_PATH}/my-path`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Interpolation of Emitter Path Config\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nemitter                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `service-name`             | service name             | Name of the service                                                                  |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `service-name-if-multiple` | service name if multiple | Name of the service if multiple, undefined if one                                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Project Parameters\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can define certain parameters that can subsequently be specified through the CLI.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nParameters can be organized in a nested structure, to access different levels of the structure, use dots (`.`) in the variable expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTherefore, parameter names should not contain `.` in their name.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be utilized in the default value of these parameters.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese parameters can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll parameters must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  base-dir:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {base-dir}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe parameter can then be specified via `--arg` in this format `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` and for nested structures `--arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cparameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e.\\\\\\\\u003cnested-parameter-name\\\\\\\\u003e=\\\\\\\\u003cvalue\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntsp compile . --arg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"base-dir=/path/to/base\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Environment variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nA TypeSpec project file can specify which environment variables it can interpolate.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe `{cwd}` and `{project-root}` variables can be used in the default value of these environment variables.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThese environment variables can then be referred to by their name in a variable interpolation expression, using the `env.` prefix.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAll environment variables must have a default value.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml title=tspconfig.yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nenvironment-variables:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  BASE_DIR:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{cwd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noutput-dir: {env.BASE_DIR}/output\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Emitter Options\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCertain emitter configurations can be interpolated using a specific rule designed to collapse a path.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf a variable is succeeded by a `/` or `.` and the emitter responsible for interpolating the config doesn't supply that variable, the path segment will be omitted.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor instance, consider the following config value: `{service-name}/output.{version}.json`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nHere's what would be produced:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Service name value | Version value | Result                    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`        | `PetStore/output.v1.json` |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"PetStore\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`       | `undefined`   | `PetStore/output.json`    |\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Built-in variables\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n| Variable name              | Scope                    | Description

Each service has versions (some preview and some GA) and each version has its own API contract, documentation, and (beta/stable) SDK package(s).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthere can never be a 2024-04-01 GA.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n9. Each new control plane api-version should be unique across all the control plane service folders for an RP Namespace. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n10.\\\\\\\\tEach service name folder must duplicate the special \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"list operations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" API. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - While this RP (not service) operation requires an api-version query parameter, the response data is not specific to this api-version; the response is api-version neutral. In addition, the response is always the same regardless of tenant/subscription. Whenever any other service in the RP gets a new api-version, the TypeSpec/OpenAPI for the operations service must also be updated to match this new api-version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cServiceName2\\\\\\\\u003e/\\\\\\\\t// Customer-facing service name; contents identical to above structure\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 data-plane/\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        \\\\u2514\\\\u2500\\\\u2500 \\\\\\\\u003cServiceName3\\\\\\\\u003e/\\\\\\\\t// Customer-facing service name; contents identical to above structure\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn this structure, Azure services are presented as an RPNamespace that is used to manage services (both with customer-facing names). Each service has versions (some preview and some GA) and each version has its own API contract, documentation, and (beta/stable) SDK package(s).   \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo enforce these rules, here are some notes about the repo structure:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.\\\\\\\\tIn the resource-manager folder, if it's a RPaaS service, there must be just 1 readme.md file, and 1+ service name folders under resource-manager/RPnamespace folder, but the resource types within each service folder must not duplicate except for operations, locations, checkNameAvailability etc. Which is required by RPaaS for HTTP request schema validation.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.\\\\\\\\tIn the data-plane folder there must be no files and at least 1 service name folder.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n3.\\\\\\\\tThe ServiceName folder must have only readme.*, tspconfig.yaml and *.tsp files in it. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - In the readme.md file, the latest package tag value (which represents a service version) must refer to OpenAPI files that are all in the exact same folder. Also, if the tag value is suffixed with \\\\u201c-preview\\\\u201d then all the OpenAPI paths must refer to files in the preview subfolder; else all OpenAPI paths must refer to files in the stable subfolder.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    - If 2+ services want to \\\\u201cshare\\\\u201d some TypeSpec/OpenAPI files, these files must be explicitly copied into a consuming service\\\\u2019s folder on its desired timeline. We do not allow multiple services to reference a single copy of a service contract because it is too dangerous to allow one service to change a shared contract, forcing other services to pick up this shared contract instantly, especially if the shared contract introduces breaking changes. Each service must be in control of its own destiny.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_wiki\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Dataplane-Codegen-Quick-Start.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Prerequisites\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Dataplane-Codegen-Quick-Start\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Prerequisites\\\\\\\\n## How to generate SDK code with Dataplane Codegen\\\\\\\\n### 1.

This guide helps you identify, review, and resolve breaking changes that may occur in new SDK versions due to migration of service specifications from Swagger to TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBreaking changes can be resolved by:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Client Customizations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nClient customizations should be implemented in a file named `client.tsp` located in the service's specification directory alongside the main entry point `main.tsp`. This `client.tsp` becomes the new specification entry point, so import `main.tsp` in the `client.tsp` file. **Do not** import `client.tsp` in the `main.tsp` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Add your customizations here\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. TypeSpec Configuration Changes\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration changes should be made in the `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the service's specification directory. This file is used to configure the TypeSpec compiler and client generator options. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Naming Changes with Numbers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPaired removal and addition entries showing naming changes from words to numbers:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` deleted or renamed its member `ZERO`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` deleted or renamed its member `THIRTY`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` added member `ENUM_0`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` added member `ENUM_30`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Swagger automatically converts numeric names to words during code generation, while TypeSpec preserves the original naming. This affects all type names, including enums, models, and operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the type definition by examining the names from the addition entries in the changelog (pattern: `Enum '\\\\\\\\u003ctype name\\\\\\\\u003e' added member xxx`):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nunion Minute {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  int32,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `0`: 0,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `30`: 30,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client customization to restore the original names from the removal entries:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Minute.`0`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ZERO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Minute.`30`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"THIRTY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2.

If the ongoing PRs are targeting to a release-* or dev-* branch which are not created or syncing from the latest main, we recommend to merge these PRs first.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. If the ongoing PRs are targeting to public main branch, Here's the suggestion to resolve the conflict. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      1. Merge latest main \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          git checkout main\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          git pull origin main // origin points to Azure rest api specs repo.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          git merge main \\\\\\\\u003cyour-pr-branch\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n          \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      2. Resolve conflicts  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        - For most of the conflicts, accept the incoming changes.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n        - If it's unclear, please accept both and then update based on your judgement with the folder structure changes above.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      3. Make sure the new change is aligned with folder structure v2  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n         There are some cases where the PR is adding a new version in the original location, but the file diffs don't show as conflict. we should move them into the correct place so that it doesn't break the folder structure v2 as instructions in **Understanding Folder Migration sections** \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n      4. clean up the previous folder if exists.  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Important**: It's strongly recommended to understand what's really changed in the folder refactor. Always ensure the new PR doesn't include any things that breaks the folder structure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### After Resolution\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to compile the TypeSpec project so that the TypeSpec Validation could pass.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. **Comprehensive validation**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`bash\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"language-basics#imports.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Imports\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/imports\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Imports\\\\\\\\n# language-basics#imports.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Imports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImports are used to include files or libraries into your TypeSpec program. When compiling a TypeSpec file, you specify the path to your root TypeSpec file, typically named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". From this root file, any imported files are added to your program. If a directory is imported, TypeSpec will search for a `main.tsp` file within that directory.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThe path specified in the import must either start with `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` or `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"../\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`, or be an absolute path. The path should either point to a directory, or have an extension of either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".js\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The examples below illustrate how to use imports to assemble a TypeSpec program from multiple files:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Importing a TypeSpec file\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./models/foo.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Importing a JavaScript file\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./decorators.js\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Importing a library\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe import value can be the name of one of the package dependencies.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"/rest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// ./node_modules/@typespec/rest/package.json\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"exports\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": { \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"typespec\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./lib/main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  }\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis results in `./node_modules/@typespec/rest/lib/main.tsp` being imported.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Package resolution algorithm\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen trying to import a package TypeSpec follows the following logic\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1.

If `exports` is not found or for back compat the `.` export is missing the `typespec` condition fallback to checking `tspMain` or `main`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Importing a directory\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the import value is a directory, TypeSpec will check if that directory is a Node package and follow the npm package [lookup logic](#importing-a-library), or if the directory contains a `main.tsp` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./models\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; // equivalent to `import \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./models/main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`typespec\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./path/to/local/module\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; // Assuming this path is a TypeSpec package, it will load it using the tspMain file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"}]\\\"}\"}]",

Open your `tspconfig.yaml` file located in your service's TypeSpec directory (e.g., `specification/discoverydev/Discovery.Workspace/tspconfig.yaml`).\\\\n2.

            "answer": "Yes, to ensure the documentation for azure-ai-transcription appears under the \"cognitive-services\" category on Microsoft Learn, you need to add or update the metadata for this package in the metadata CSV file located at https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/_data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv.\nSpecifically, you should:\n1. Find (or add) the row for azure-ai-transcription in python-packages.csv.\n2. Set the MSDocService field to \"cognitive-services\". This value is used to correctly categorize the package in the Learn docs hierarchy.\n3. Ensure other relevant fields (ServiceName, DisplayName, Type, etc.) are filled in appropriately.\nAfter updating the CSV, commit and create a PR in the azure-sdk repo. Once merged, the next docs build will pick up the new metadata and your package will be categorized correctly.\nIf the Notes field for your package is set to \"Needs Review\", update it to another value to avoid automation overwriting your changes.\nReferences and field details can be found here:\n- [CSV field README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\n- [Relevant CSV file for Python packages](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/_data/releases/latest/python-packages.csv)\nIn summary: Yes, registering your package in the metadata CSV with MSDocService: cognitive-services is required. This action will resolve the warning and correct the Learn categorization.\n**References**\n[Publish SDK reference docs / Onboard a released package | Azure-sdk-docs-eng](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/develop/sdk-docs)\n[Metadata CSV update process for Python | Azure Sdk For Python Docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/deprecation_process.md)",

This guide expands on how Azure Services should define Preview versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Preview Versioning Rules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Always make the last enum the preview and apply `@previewVersion` to it.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Apply `@added(Versions.PreviewVersion)` to all preview items - these items will not show up in any GA Version\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For a new GA, add a new version enum **BEFORE** the preview enum value. Manually change all **preview** items that are GA'ing so that the `@added` version value matches the new GA enum value\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- For any items remaining in **preview**, rename the **old preview** enum value to the **new preview** enum value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Usage Examples\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### New preview Version\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the following example we introduce a new preview version called `v3Preview` which includes everything from `v2` plus adds a new property to the `Widget` resource.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`diff

You'll need to\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e [!NOTE]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\\\\\\\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n*before* releasing.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays. If your data is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnot updated and you don't want to wait, [run the job manually](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=1284).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nThis will update the metadata PR.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you find anything unexpected in the table of contents or service README, check the\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n[metadata CSV file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/tree/main/_data/releases/latest) to ensure that the metadata is\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ncorrect.

        "expected": {
            "answer": "The \"black\" job in the Azure SDK for Python pipeline can fail for reasons beyond just code formatting. Even if running \"black\" locally with the same version (24.4.0) does not produce changes, there are a few areas to check for a root cause:\n1. Run Black with the Same Arguments as the Pipeline:The pipeline runs \"black\" using tox with specific arguments. Make sure you are running locally in the same way. From the official guidance, run: `tox run -e black -c ../../../eng/tox/tox.ini --root . -- .` This ensures that the same config files, paths, and excludes are used. The pipeline may use a different configuration or target files that you are not formatting locally. Or you can tried the same command used by ci: `python -m azpysdk.main black --isolate sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects`.\n2. Check for Hidden Files or Config Differences: The pipeline uses the repository\u2019s configuration, including pyproject.toml and any exclude/include patterns. Local runs may inadvertently skip files due to local ignore files, environment differences, or working directory mismatches. Double-check that your local environment matches the CI context.\n3. Run `git status` or `git diff` to find out whether there are files already formatted but not pushed to the pr.\n4. Line Endings and Whitespace: Sometimes, black fails due to line ending differences (CRLF vs LF) or invisible whitespace issues that are not flagged locally. Make sure your files have consistent line endings (prefer LF in repo).\n5. Check the Pipeline Log for Specific Files: Review the pipeline's failure log closely to see which files are reported as needing formatting. Sometimes, it\u2019s a file outside your typical working set (such as generated code or test files).\n6. Reproduce in a Clean Environment: To eliminate local state issues, clone your repo in a fresh directory and re-run the pipeline\u2019s black command as above. If you confirm that running \"black\" via tox in a clean environment with the same version does not report changes, but the pipeline still fails, check for possible pipeline caching or artifact issues. Otherwise, use the pipeline log to identify exactly which file is causing the failure and focus on that file. Removing the check is not recommended; instead, focus on aligning your local runs with the pipeline invocation. If you continue to see unexplained failures, reach out in the Azure SDK language team channel with your findings and the specific pipeline log excerpt.",

            "answer": "The 'black' job in the Azure SDK pipeline fails on your PR even though running 'black' version 24.4.0 locally does not make any changes, likely due to differences in environment or file handling between your local setup and the CI pipeline. Common causes include:\n\n1. **Line endings (LF vs CRLF):** The pipeline may expect files to use LF line endings, while your local files may use CRLF (especially on Windows). 'black' can fail if line endings are inconsistent, even if code formatting is correct.\n2. **Untracked or ignored files:** Sometimes, files not staged or committed locally are present in the CI workspace, causing unexpected formatting failures.\n3. **File encoding or permissions:** Rarely, encoding or permission differences can cause 'black' to behave differently.\n\n**How to resolve:**\n- Ensure your repository enforces LF line endings for all Python files. Add a `.gitattributes` file at the root of your repo with:\n  ```\n  * text=auto eol=lf\n  ```\n  This forces git to check out files with LF endings, matching CI expectations.\n- Run `git clean -xdf` and `git pull` to ensure your local repo matches the CI workspace.\n- Run `black` again after enforcing LF endings and commit any changes.\n- Double-check that all files are staged and committed before pushing.\n\nThis should resolve the mismatch between local and CI formatting checks without removing the 'black' check from the pipeline.",

            "answer": "The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\nHere are practical steps:\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\n```\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\nsphinx = false\n```",

            "answer": "To resolve the Python docstring errors and warnings during the 'Build Docs' stage, you need to update the TypeSpec documentation comments for your Response model and ServiceTier union to ensure they follow CommonMark markdown formatting and avoid problematic constructs that confuse Sphinx/docutils.\n\n**Key steps:**\n\n1. **Use Proper Markdown in TypeSpec Documentation**\n   - TypeSpec supports CommonMark markdown in doc comments. However, emitters and downstream doc generators (like Sphinx) can be sensitive to indentation, block quotes, bullet lists, and duplicate explicit target names.\n   - Avoid block quotes (lines starting with '>'), excessive indentation, and ensure bullet lists have blank lines before and after.\n   - For links, avoid using the same explicit target name multiple times (e.g., \"[Learn more](...)\" repeated).\n\n2. **Update Response Model Documentation**\n   - Review all doc comments in the Response model and its properties. Remove or fix any block quotes, ensure bullet lists are separated by blank lines, and avoid unexpected indentation.\n   - Example:\n     ```tsp\n     /**\n      * The output of the response.\n      *\n      * - Item 1\n      * - Item 2\n      *\n      * See [documentation](https://example.com).\n      */\n     output: string;\n     ```\n     Ensure there is a blank line before and after the bullet list, and avoid block quotes.\n\n3. **Update ServiceTier Union Documentation**\n   - For unions, especially those representing enums, ensure the doc comment does not use problematic bullet lists or indentation.\n   - Example:\n     ```tsp\n     /**\n      * Service tier options:\n      *\n      * - auto\n      * - default\n      * - flex\n      * - scale\n      * - priority\n      */\n     union ServiceTier {\n       \"auto\",\n       \"default\",\n       \"flex\",\n       \"scale\",\n       \"priority\",\n     }\n     ```\n     Again, blank lines before/after the list help Sphinx parse correctly.\n\n4. **Avoid Duplicate Explicit Target Names in Links**\n   - If you have multiple links with the same text (e.g., \"[Learn more](...)\") in the same docstring, change the link text or use inline links instead of reference-style links.\n\n5. **Regenerate and Validate**\n   - After updating your TypeSpec files, re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python docs. The warnings/errors should be resolved if the markdown is well-formed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Use clean, minimal markdown in TypeSpec doc comments.\n- Avoid block quotes, excessive indentation, and duplicate link targets.\n- Ensure bullet lists are separated by blank lines.\n- Regenerate and validate docs after changes.\n\nIf you continue to see errors, review the generated Python docstrings for any remaining problematic markdown and adjust your TypeSpec comments accordingly.",

Remove or fix any block quotes, ensure bullet lists are separated by blank lines, and avoid unexpected indentation.\\\\n   - Example:\\\\n     ```tsp\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * The output of the response.\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - Item 1\\\\n      * - Item 2\\\\n      *\\\\n      * See [documentation](https://example.com).\\\\n      */\\\\n     output: string;\\\\n     ```\\\\n     Ensure there is a blank line before and after the bullet list, and avoid block quotes.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Update ServiceTier Union Documentation**\\\\n   - For unions, especially those representing enums, ensure the doc comment does not use problematic bullet lists or indentation.\\\\n   - Example:\\\\n     ```tsp\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * Service tier options:\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - auto\\\\n      * - default\\\\n      * - flex\\\\n      * - scale\\\\n      * - priority\\\\n      */\\\\n     union ServiceTier {\\\\n       \\\\\\\"auto\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"flex\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"scale\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"priority\\\\\\\",\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n     Again, blank lines before/after the list help Sphinx parse correctly.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Avoid Duplicate Explicit Target Names in Links**\\\\n   - If you have multiple links with the same text (e.g., \\\\\\\"[Learn more](...)\\\\\\\") in the same docstring, change the link text or use inline links instead of reference-style links.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Regenerate and Validate**\\\\n   - After updating your TypeSpec files, re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python docs. The warnings/errors should be resolved if the markdown is well-formed.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Use clean, minimal markdown in TypeSpec doc comments.\\\\n- Avoid block quotes, excessive indentation, and duplicate link targets.\\\\n- Ensure bullet lists are separated by blank lines.\\\\n- Regenerate and validate docs after changes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you continue to see errors, review the generated Python docstrings for any remaining problematic markdown and adjust your TypeSpec comments accordingly.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\\\\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\\\\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\\\\nHere are practical steps:\\\\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\\\\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\\\\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\\\\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\\\\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\\\\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\\\\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nsphinx = false\\\\n```\\\"}\"}]",

The guidance I got from API board a month ago is that main.tsp should only list the latest preview. API version  But doing so triggered this error. \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nShould this be an error?  Or can we make this into a warning instead?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should only track the latest preview version in your TypeSpec files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf there are older preview Swagger files still in the repo, they can remain there for the required 90-day deprecation window, even if they're no longer listed in your .tsp files.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nWhile TypeSpec validation currently throws an error if Swagger files exist without a matching version in TypeSpec, you can suppress this error by adding an entry to suppressions.yaml in your service's spec folder (not the global one).\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLonger-term, the goal is to eliminate swagger files entirely, but for now, swagger and TypeSpec coexist. So:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKeep only the latest preview in .tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nKeep older generated swagger for 90 days\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAdd suppressions if needed to prevent TypeSpec validation from failing\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"dev#mgmt#operation_migration.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/mgmt/operation_migration.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\\n## Why These Changes?\\\\\\\\n# dev#mgmt#operation_migration.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Azure SDK Migration Guide: New Operation Design Generation Breaking Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Why These Changes?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur operations prioritize consistency with the underlying REST API:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Better API Alignment**: Keyword-only parameters improve traceability between code and request body.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Improved Developer Experience**: Keyword-only parameters enable IDEs to provide rich type hints with parameter names.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- **Maintainability**: Enum-based conditions makes the SDK easier to maintain and understand.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you encounter issues not covered here, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/issues) with tag `emitter:client:python`.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"typespec_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"emitters#clients#introduction.mdx\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Client Emitters\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/clients/introduction\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Client Emitters\\\\\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\\\\\n# emitters#clients#introduction.mdx\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Client Emitters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Disclaimer\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003cAside\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**All client emitters are in preview**.

Can we remove this model? (omit-unreachable-types: true does not work)\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## answer\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf the `OkResponse` model is being emitted but not actually referenced, that does sound like a bug \\\\u2014 we shouldn't be generating unused models. Especially in cases like this where you're doing a long-running POST action and the 200 response is effectively empty, it\\\\u2019s more accurate to model the operation with just a `202` and an error response.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFor your case, you can avoid using `OkResponse` entirely by switching to `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync` or passing `never` as the third argument. That will prevent the generation of the unnecessary `OkResponse` model.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, keep in mind that for LROs, the POST operation typically doesn't return 200 anyway. That response is just a placeholder in the old pattern to signal \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"void\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". If you're converting from existing Swagger, and it doesn\\\\u2019t actually return 200, you should be able to safely drop that response from the Swagger and avoid the breaking change.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, if you do need to customize the final response for the LRO, `getLroResponse` can be used to override the response returned at the end of the operation \\\\u2014 no need to rely on `OkResponse` at all.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n# TSP Install fails with below error\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n## question \\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nI am trying to install TSP and its dependencies and it fails with below error.

For these scenarios, you can use the [`namespace` configuration option](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/libraries/typespec-client-generator-core/reference/emitter/#namespace) in your `tspconfig.yaml` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIf you want the published SDK to follow closely with the package structure and namespaces in your TypeSpec file, you should also pass in the `package-name` flag with the desired value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Using the `namespace` Flag\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `namespace` option allows you to specify where the generated code should be placed within your package structure. This is particularly useful for cases where you want to:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Keep generated code isolated in a dedicated subdirectory\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2.

Make sure there are configuration for Python SDK like:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nparameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"service-dir\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    default: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR-SERVICE-DIRECTORY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nemit: [\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-autorest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // this value does not affect python code generation\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n]\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    emitter-output-dir: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{output-dir}/{service-dir}/YOUR-PACKAGE-DIR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    namespace: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR.NAMESPACE.NAME\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n    flavor: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n`YOUR.NAMESPACE.NAME` is your namespace name; `YOUR-PACKAGE-DIR` is your package directory; `YOUR-SERVICE-DIRECTORY` is SDK directory name. For example, assume that namespace is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure.ai.anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and you want to put it in folder \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure-sdk-for-python/sdk/anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR.NAMESPACE.NAME\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure.ai.anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR_PACKAGE_DIR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"azure-ai-anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"YOUR-SERVICE-DIRECTORY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sdk/anomalydetector\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"document_source\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_filename\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"dev#mgmt#sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Azure Python SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide for TypeSpec Migration\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"document_link\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/mgmt/sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"# Azure Python SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide for TypeSpec Migration\\\\\\\\n# dev#mgmt#sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Azure Python SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide for TypeSpec Migration\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Azure Python SDK generally prohibits breaking changes unless they result from service behavior modifications. This guide helps you identify, review, and resolve breaking changes that may occur in new SDK versions due to migration of service specifications from Swagger to TypeSpec.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nBreaking changes can be resolved by:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n1. Client Customizations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nClient customizations should be implemented in a file named `client.tsp` located in the service's specification directory alongside the main entry point `main.tsp`. This `client.tsp` becomes the new specification entry point, so import `main.tsp` in the `client.tsp` file. **Do not** import `client.tsp` in the `main.tsp` file.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"./main.tsp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nimport \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nusing Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n// Add your customizations here\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n2. TypeSpec Configuration Changes\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nTypeSpec configuration changes should be made in the `tspconfig.yaml` file located in the service's specification directory. This file is used to configure the TypeSpec compiler and client generator options. For example:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`yaml\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\noptions:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 1. Naming Changes with Numbers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPaired removal and addition entries showing naming changes from words to numbers:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` deleted or renamed its member `ZERO`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` deleted or renamed its member `THIRTY`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` added member `ENUM_0`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Enum `Minute` added member `ENUM_30`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Swagger automatically converts numeric names to words during code generation, while TypeSpec preserves the original naming. This affects all type names, including enums, models, and operations.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the type definition by examining the names from the addition entries in the changelog (pattern: `Enum '\\\\\\\\u003ctype name\\\\\\\\u003e' added member xxx`):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nunion Minute {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  int32,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `0`: 0,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  `30`: 30,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client customization to restore the original names from the removal entries:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Minute.`0`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ZERO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Minute.`30`, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"THIRTY\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 2. Operation Naming Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval of an operation and addition of a similarly named operation for the same operation group:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Added operation StorageTaskAssignmentOperations.storage_task_assignment_list\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Removed operation StorageTaskAssignmentOperations.list\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: TypeSpec may generate different operation names than Swagger to avoid naming collisions.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nLocate the interface and operation using the name from the addition entries.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface StorageTaskAssignment {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  op storageTaskAssignmentList(xxx): xxx;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client naming to restore the original operation name from the removal entries:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(StorageTaskAssignment.storageTaskAssignmentList, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"list\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 3. Naming Changes from Directive\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nPaired removal and addition entries showing naming changes for structs:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Added model `RedisResource`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `ResourceInfo`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nAlso, in the legacy config for swagger under the spec folder: `specification/\\\\\\\\u003cservice\\\\\\\\u003e/resource-manager/readme.python.md`, the renaming directives could be found:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ndirective:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- rename-model:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  from: 'RedisResource'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  to: 'ResourceInfo'\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Swagger has directive ways to change the naming.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the type definition by examining the names from the addition entries in the changelog (pattern: `Added model '\\\\\\\\u003ctype name\\\\\\\\u003e'`):\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nmodel RedisResource {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUse client customization to do the same renaming as the directives in the legacy config:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(RedisResource, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ResourceInfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 4. Client Naming Changes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval entry showing naming change of the client:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed client `IotDpsClient`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: TypeSpec generates client names based on the `namespace` name rather than the title annotation in the `@service` decorator.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nFind the name from namespace:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@service(#{ title: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"iotDpsClient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" })\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nnamespace Microsoft.Devices;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nUpdate it to the correct client name using `@@clientName`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@clientName(Microsoft.Devices, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"IotDpsClient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 5. Reorder of Parameters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEntry showing the parameters get re-ordered for an operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Method `IotDpsResourceOperations.get` re-ordered its parameters from `['self', 'provisioning_service_name', 'resource_group_name', 'kwargs']` to `['self', 'resource_group_name', 'provisioning_service_name', 'kwargs']`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: TypeSpec generally uses generic to generate operations. An unified parameters' order will be widely shared in one operation group, and may make difference comparing to what defined in swagger.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Spec Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOperation extends parameters from type `ProvisioningServiceDescription`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@armResourceOperations\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\ninterface ProvisioningServiceDescriptions {\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  get is ArmResourceRead\\\\\\\\u003cProvisioningServiceDescription, Error = ErrorDetails\\\\\\\\u003e;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nOverride the operation by a customized one with a manually designed order of parameters:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`tsp\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nop IotDpsResourceGetCustomized(\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provider: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft.ThisWillBeReplaced\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  @path\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  provisioningServiceName: string,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  ...Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.ResourceGroupNameParameter,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n): ProvisioningServiceDescription;\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n@@override(ProvisioningServiceDescriptions.get,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  IotDpsResourceGetCustomized,\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 6. Common Types Upgrade\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMultiple changes related to common infrastructure types such as `SystemData` and `IdentityType`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `IdentityType`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Common types are upgraded to their latest versions during TypeSpec migration.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Low impact since these are common infrastructure types rarely used directly by users.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 7. Removal of Unreferenced Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMultiple removals of unreferenced models that are typically not used in the SDK:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `ProxyResourceWithoutSystemData`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `Resource`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Unreferenced models are removed during TypeSpec migration.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Low impact since these models are typically not used directly by users.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 8. Removal of Pageable Models\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nMultiple removals of models following the pattern `xxxList`:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `ElasticSanList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `SkuInformationList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `SnapshotList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `VolumeGroupList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Deleted or renamed model `VolumeList`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Python will not expose pageable models for list APIs.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Low impact since these models are typically not used directly by users.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 9. Parameters Changed to Keyword-only\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nEntries showing the usage of passing parameters positionally is disabled:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Method `DpsCertificateOperations.delete` changed its parameter `certificate_name1` from `positional_or_keyword` to `keyword_only`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Query and header parameters in operation methods have been changed from positional to keyword-only by the new operation design.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Users should convert all positional parameters to keyword arguments\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 10. Removal of Parameter `if_match`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval of parameter `if_match` and addition of `etag/match_condition` for the same operation:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `DpsCertificateOperations` added parameter `etag` in method `create_or_update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `DpsCertificateOperations` added parameter `match_condition` in method `create_or_update`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Method `DpsCertificateOperations.create_or_update` deleted or renamed its parameter `if_match` of kind `positional_or_keyword`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Header signatures `if_match/if_none_match` is replaced by `etag/match_condition` by the new operation design.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Impact**: Replace `if_match=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cspecific etag\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` with `etag=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u003cspecific etag\\\\\\\\u003e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", match_condition=MatchConditions.IfNotModified`.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Resolution**: Accept these breaking changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## 11. Removal of multi-level flattened properties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changelog Pattern**:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nRemoval of multiple parameters and addition of parameters `properties` entries for the same model:\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`md\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` added property `properties`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `integrity_key`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `encryption_key`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `encryption_key_thumbprint`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n- Model `VaultExtendedInfoResource` deleted or renamed its instance variable `algorithm`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n**Reason**: Typespec no longer supports multi-level flattening and will always preserve the actual REST API hierarchy.

However, emitters and downstream doc generators (like Sphinx) can be sensitive to indentation, block quotes, bullet lists, and duplicate explicit target names.\\\\n   - Avoid block quotes (lines starting with '>'), excessive indentation, and ensure bullet lists have blank lines before and after.\\\\n   - For links, avoid using the same explicit target name multiple times (e.g., \\\\\\\"[Learn more](...)\\\\\\\" repeated).\\\\n\\\\n2. **Update Response Model Documentation**\\\\n   - Review all doc comments in the Response model and its properties. Remove or fix any block quotes, ensure bullet lists are separated by blank lines, and avoid unexpected indentation.\\\\n   - Example:\\\\n     ```tsp\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * The output of the response.\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - Item 1\\\\n      * - Item 2\\\\n      *\\\\n      * See [documentation](https://example.com).\\\\n      */\\\\n     output: string;\\\\n     ```\\\\n     Ensure there is a blank line before and after the bullet list, and avoid block quotes.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Update ServiceTier Union Documentation**\\\\n   - For unions, especially those representing enums, ensure the doc comment does not use problematic bullet lists or indentation.\\\\n   - Example:\\\\n     ```tsp\\\\n     /**\\\\n      * Service tier options:\\\\n      *\\\\n      * - auto\\\\n      * - default\\\\n      * - flex\\\\n      * - scale\\\\n      * - priority\\\\n      */\\\\n     union ServiceTier {\\\\n       \\\\\\\"auto\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"flex\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"scale\\\\\\\",\\\\n       \\\\\\\"priority\\\\\\\",\\\\n     }\\\\n     ```\\\\n     Again, blank lines before/after the list help Sphinx parse correctly.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Avoid Duplicate Explicit Target Names in Links**\\\\n   - If you have multiple links with the same text (e.g., \\\\\\\"[Learn more](...)\\\\\\\") in the same docstring, change the link text or use inline links instead of reference-style links.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Regenerate and Validate**\\\\n   - After updating your TypeSpec files, re-run `tsp-client update` and rebuild your Python docs. The warnings/errors should be resolved if the markdown is well-formed.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Use clean, minimal markdown in TypeSpec doc comments.\\\\n- Avoid block quotes, excessive indentation, and duplicate link targets.\\\\n- Ensure bullet lists are separated by blank lines.\\\\n- Regenerate and validate docs after changes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you continue to see errors, review the generated Python docstrings for any remaining problematic markdown and adjust your TypeSpec comments accordingly.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"The Sphinx docstring errors you're seeing in the generated Python SDK (unexpected indentation, block quote ends without a blank line, duplicate explicit target names, bullet/definition list issues) are caused by how TypeSpec documentation comments are emitted into Python docstrings, especially when those comments use Markdown or formatting that doesn't map cleanly to reStructuredText (reST), which Sphinx expects.\\\\nTo resolve these errors, there are two possible solutions:\\\\n1. You need to ensure that the TypeSpec doc comments for the Response model and ServiceTier union are written in a way that avoids problematic Markdown constructs and closely follows what Sphinx/reST expects.\\\\nHere are practical steps:\\\\n- **Bullet/Definition List Formatting:** - Avoid using Markdown bullet lists (`*`, `-`, or `+`) or definition lists in your TypeSpec doc comments. Instead, use plain sentences, or, if you need a list, format it as numbered items with clear line breaks between each item. - If you must use a list, add a blank line before and after the list, and ensure each item starts on a new line. Do not nest lists or use complex indentation.\\\\n- **Inline Strong/Emphasis Markup:** - If you use `**bold**` or `*italic*` in TypeSpec comments, Sphinx may misinterpret these if not balanced. Prefer using plain text or ensure that every start marker has a matching end marker.\\\\n- **Explicit Targets (Links):** - If you use `[Learn more](url)` in doc comments, emitting these into Python docstrings can result in duplicate explicit target names. Use plain URLs or avoid repeating the same anchor text multiple times.\\\\n- **Block Quotes:** - Avoid using Markdown block quotes (`>`) in TypeSpec doc comments. If you need to highlight something, use plain sentences.\\\\n- **Unexpected Indentation:** - Ensure all TypeSpec doc comments are left-aligned, with no leading spaces or tabs before the text, unless you are deliberately creating a code block. For code blocks, use triple backticks and add blank lines before and after the block.\\\\n- **General Style:** - Write documentation in simple paragraphs. Do not mix Markdown with reST, and avoid complex formatting. - Example of a safe docstring for a model property: ```tsp /** * The list of available service tiers. Possible values include: * 1. Basic - Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard - Recommended for most workloads. * 3. Premium - Advanced tier for high throughput. */ ``` - Avoid: ```tsp /** * - Basic * - Standard * - Premium */ ``` **Actionable Steps:** - Go to your TypeSpec definitions for Response and ServiceTier, and revise any doc comments containing bullet lists, definition lists, block quotes, repeated anchor text, or excessive indentation. Replace with simple sentences or numbered lists as above. - After making these changes, regenerate the Python SDK and run the Sphinx build again. The warnings/errors should be resolved. - For reference on Python docstring formatting and Sphinx compatibility, see the Azure Python SDK [docstring guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/docstring.md). If you need a specific example for ServiceTier: ```tsp /** * Service tier for deployment. Possible values: * 1. Basic: Entry-level tier. * 2. Standard: Recommended tier. * 3. Premium: Advanced tier for large workloads. */ union ServiceTier { ... } ``` And for Response model, ensure any lists or references are in plain sentences and do not use block quotes or repeated links.\\\\n2. Or you can disable the sphinx environment within the pyproject.toml for the problematic package. By that way you won't hit these sphinx failures.\\\\n```\\\\n[tool.azure-sdk-build]\\\\nsphinx = false\\\\n```\\\"}\"}]",
