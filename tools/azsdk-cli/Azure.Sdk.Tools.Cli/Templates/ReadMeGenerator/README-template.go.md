## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Supported](https://aka.ms/azsdk/go/supported-versions) version of Go - [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Azure subscription - [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- <Include examples on how to deploy this resource using the Azure CLI, and via the Azure Portal>

### Install the package

Install the Azure <TODO: package name goes here> client module for Go with [go get][goget]:

```
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/<package path>
```

# Key concepts

# Troubleshooting

### Logging

This module uses the classification-based logging implementation in `azcore`. To enable console logging for all SDK modules, set `AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING` to `all`. Use the `azcore/log` package to control log event output or to enable logs for `azidentity` only. For example:
```go
import azlog "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore/log"

// print log output to stdout
azlog.SetListener(func(event azlog.Event, s string) {
    fmt.Println(s)
})

// include only azidentity credential logs
azlog.SetEvents(azidentity.EventAuthentication)
```
