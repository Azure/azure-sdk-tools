            "comment": "### API Summary\n\n**Purpose**  \nThis API provides functionality for managing secrets within a vault environment. It enables the orchestration of CRUD operations along with specialized actions such as backing up, restoring, and rolling secrets, as well as handling deletion and recovery scenarios.\n\n**API Version**  \nThe API defines its supported versions through the `ApiVersion` class. Among the available versions, the latest is `7.7-preview.1`, which represents the most recent iteration of the service.\n\n**Client Classes**  \nThe primary classes of interest to architects are the synchronous `SecretClient` and the asynchronous `aio.SecretClient`. Both provide equivalent secret management capabilities while accommodating different execution models, ensuring that developers can integrate secret operations into both traditional and asynchronous codebases.\n\n**Functional Overview**  \nThe client classes facilitate comprehensive secret management by supporting CRUD operations and additional secret-specific workflows. They allow users to set new secrets, retrieve secret values, update secret attributes, and remove secrets from the vault. Beyond standard operations, the clients enable advanced functionalities such as creating backups, restoring from backups, and managing secret lifecycle processes, including secure deletion and recovery. The design also accommodates custom HTTP request handling for extended control during operation execution.",
