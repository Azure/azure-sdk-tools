## Rust SDK APIView Exporter

This TypeScript project reads a Rustdoc JSON file and generates a new Rust API view capturing the exported API surface. The project filters the items to include only those with public visibility and preserves the parent-child hierarchy.

### Features
- Reads a Rustdoc JSON file (docs.api.json).
- Extracts the exported API surface.
- Filters items to include only those with public visibility.
- Preserves the parent-child hierarchy.
- Writes the exported API surface to a new Rust file (docs.rs).

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed. You can install Node.js from nodejs.org.

### Usage
- `npm install`
- `npm i -g typescript ts-node`
- Place the docs.api.json file: Ensure the docs.api.json file generated by rustdoc is placed in the inputs directory.

### Run the project:
- `ts-node src/main.ts`
- Output: The exported API surface will be saved to `outputs/docs.rs` in the outputs directory.
