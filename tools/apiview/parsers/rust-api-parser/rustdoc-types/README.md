# Rustdoc Types

This project provides tools to convert Rust models into TypeScript types using `[typeshare](https://github.com/1password/typeshare)`.

## Setup

1. **Install Rust/Cargo**:
    Follow https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html
    Restart the terminal to use `cargo`.

2. **Install Typeshare CLI**:
    ```sh
    cargo install typeshare-cli
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cargo vendor
    ```
    This will create the `vendor` directory with all required dependencies.

## Dependencies

This project uses vendored dependencies to ensure consistent rustdoc-types. The `rustdoc-types` dependency is vendored in the `vendor` directory and is configured through `.cargo/config.toml`.

### Updating rustdoc-types Version

1. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rustdoc-types = "0.33.0"  # Replace with desired version
    ```

2. **Vendor Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cargo vendor
    ```
    This will update the vendored copy in `vendor/rustdoc-types/`.

3. Verify that the `FORMAT_VERSION` in `vendor/rustdoc-types/src/lib.rs` matches with the desired version in your rustdoc output from the azure-sdk-for-rust repository.

## Usage

1. The source `lib.rs` is located at `vendor/rustdoc-types/src/lib.rs`. This file contains the definitions that will be converted to TypeScript.

2. **Generate `output/lib-typeshare.rs` from `lib.rs`**:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```
    This will add `#[typeshare]` attributes to the `lib.rs`.

3. **Generate TypeScript Definitions**:
    ```sh
    typeshare ./output/lib-typeshare.rs --lang=typescript --output-file=output/typeshare-result.ts
    ```
    This will generate `output/typeshare-result.ts` with TypeScript types.

    Shortcomings:
    1. Does not copy forward the const `FORMAT_VERSION`
    2. `FunctionSignature#inputs` field (a tuple) is skipped, because typeshare cannot handle tuples.
    3. Generates `{type_typeshare: "TypeName", content_typeshare: {property: "value"}}` as opposed to `{TypeName: {property: "value"}}` for enums.
        - `#[serde(tag = "type_typeshare", content = "content_typeshare")]` attributes were added for Enums because typeshare forced us to.

4. **Post Processing**: 
    Handle the typeshare shortcomings with a post-processing script.
    ```sh
    ts-node post-processing.ts
    ```

## Version Compatibility

The `FORMAT_VERSION` in `vendor/rustdoc-types/src/lib.rs` is critical for compatibility with rustdoc JSON output. When updating the vendored `rustdoc-types`:

1. Check the `FORMAT_VERSION` value in the new version
2. Verify it's compatible with your rustdoc JSON output version
3. If they don't match, you may need to use a different version of `rustdoc-types`

Current `FORMAT_VERSION`: 37 (as of rustdoc-types 0.33.0)
