{"testcase": "Fixing Invalid Type Specifications and SDK Regeneration in Released APIs", "query": "title: Fixing Invalid Type Specifications and SDK Regeneration in Released APIs\n\nquestion: Hi Azure SDK Onboarding,\nOur team found an invalid type specification in our previous 2 API releases (1 preview, 1 stable).  I've read through (lightly) the breaking change deep dive, which looks like I'll have to reach out to the review board to get their approval, however, I was wondering what is the recommended way to implement a fix for existing APIs, up to the point where it can be reviewed by ARM and Breaking changes board.\nNormally, I would create a branch, commit a base version for review, then create a release plan against the new branch (then add in changes, get ARM sign off, then request the sdk release).\nHow do I regenerate the SDKs once I have a fix in place for the previously released verisons?  Will they require manual updates (e.g. create a PR in each sdk repo with a fix)?\nAny guidance would be appreciated!", "ground_truth": "To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs and regenerate SDKs, you should follow these steps:\nFix the Spec and Follow Breaking Change Process: If your fix is a breaking change or a bug fix in an already released API version, you must submit a PR against the main branch of the public Azure REST API specs repository. If your PR is labeled with BreakingChangeReviewRequired or VersioningReviewRequired, you must get approval from the Breaking Change Review Board (see aka.ms/brch). For bug fixes, you may be able to apply the BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix label yourself, but the process should be strictly followed.\nARM Review: Once the breaking change review is resolved, request ARM review. Note: You cannot proceed to ARM review until the breaking change process is complete.\nSDK Generation and Release Plan:\nFor TypeSpec-based management plane SDKs (Java, JavaScript, Python, Go):\nUse the release planner to request SDK generation for the fixed API version. This will create a tracking issue in the Azure/sdk-release-request repo.\nThe Shanghai SDK team will generate the SDK and open a PR in the corresponding SDK repository. However, it is the service owner's responsibility to follow up, complete any customizations, and drive the PR through review and merge. You will be notified when the PR is created.\nAfter the SDK is generated, follow the release guidance to publish the package.\nFor .NET: Service owners must generate the SDK manually using the updated TypeSpec, then create and submit a PR to the azure-sdk-for-net repository.\nManual Follow-Up: While the initial SDK PRs for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go are created automatically after you request generation, you are still responsible for any manual updates, review, and merging of these PRs. For .NET, all steps are manual after generation.\nSummary:\nYou do not need to manually create PRs in each SDK repo for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go; the release planner and SDK generation pipelines will create draft PRs for you after you request generation.\nYou must still review, customize (if needed), and drive the SDK PRs to completion.\nFor .NET, the process is manual: you generate and submit the PR yourself.\nAlways ensure you have breaking change and ARM approvals before requesting SDK generation.\nFor more details, see the referenced documentation below.",
