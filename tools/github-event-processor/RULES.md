# Azure SDK Repository Automation Rules

- [Issue Rules](#issue-rules)
- [Pull Request Rules](#pull-request-rules)
- [Scheduled rules](#scheduled-rules)

# Overview

## Nomenclature

- **Trigger**: An event that occurs in GitHub to which automation should respond to.
- **Target**: An item in GitHub that can trigger an event.  Generally, this will be an issue or pull request.
- **Criteria**: A set of evaluations performed for a trigger target that determines which actions, if any, result.
- **Actions**: A set of "things that happen" in response to a trigger. For example, adding a label to an issue.

## Data integrations

- **Service partners**: Each partner team that owns packages in our repository will need to have an association tracking a service label to one or more GitHub handles.  The contacts for service teams will follow the same pattern as the "Service Attention" process does today; it must be possible to assign a set of service owners that differs from the individuals assigned as pull request reviewers. If it exists, this information is in the repository's CODEOWNERS file.

  Example:

```text
# ServiceLabel: %Event Grid %Service Attention
/sdk/eventgrid/                                                    @user1 @user2 @user3 @user4
```

- **Azure SDK team owners**: Each package in our repository that is owned by our team will need to have an association tracking a service label to one or more GitHub handles.  This is an unofficial mapping that does not necessarily correlate to authoritative "Azure SDK Team" membership, such as that represented by our security groups or the "[azure-sdk-team](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/orgs/Azure/teams/azure-sdk-team)" GitHub team.  That said, using one of these groups to validate membership on top of the label association would be just fine. *Right now, this does not exist, this would require changes to CODEOWNERS which are still pending.* If it exists, the Service Label to user mapping is in the repository's CODEOWNERS file.

  Example:

```text
# ServiceLabel: %Event Hubs
/sdk/eventhub/                                                     @user1 @user2 @user3
```

- **File paths**: A service label may have one or more file paths relative to the repository structure associated with it. If it exists, this information is in the repository's CODEOWNERS file today.

  Example:

```text
# # PRLabel: %Attestation
/sdk/attestation/                                                  @user1 @user2
/sdk/attestation/azure-security-attestation                        @user3 @Azure/fake-team-name
```

## External integrations

### AI label service

This is a REST API that evaluates the content of an issue and attempts to predict a set of labels that should be applied to it.  If a prediction is made with a reasonable level of confidence, the service will return exactly one service label and one category label.  If confidence thresholds were not met for both label types, no labels are returned. The AI label service can only a response with labels for [officially supported repositories]
(<https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/github-labels/repositories.txt>). For libraries that are not supported it an empty response will be returned.

#### Example payload

```json
{
  "issueNumber": 32227,
  "title": "Move Snippet Generator to .NET 6",
  "body": "The snippet generator tool currently targets netcoreapp 3.1 which reaches end-of-life in December, 2022. The target framework should be updated to net6.0 and the associated Update-Snippet script should be updated to reference the new version.",
  "issueUserLogin": "person1",
  "repositoryName": "azure-sdk-for-net",
  "repositoryOwnerName": "Azure"
}
```

#### Example responses

_**Predictions made**_

```json
{
  "labels": [
    "Storage",
    "Client"
  ]
}
```

_**No predictions**_

```json
{
  "labels": []
}
```

### Important context

This is a stand-alone service providing a REST API which requires a service key to access. The service key is pulled pulled from KeyVault and stored as a secret in the action's environment.

# Issue Rules

## Initial issue triage

### Trigger

- Issue created

### Criteria

- Issue has no labels
- Issue has no assignee

### Actions

- Evaluate the user that created the issue:

    ```text
    IF creator is NOT an Azure SDK team owner
      AND is NOT a member of the Azure organization
      AND is does NOT have a collaborator association
      AND does NOT have write permission
      AND does NOT have admin permission:

          - Add "customer-reported" label
          - Add "question" label
    ```

- Query AI label service for suggestions:
  - _This is what we have today_

    ```text
    IF labels were predicted
        - Assign returned labels to the issue
        - Add "needs-team-triage" label to the issue
    ELSE
        - Add "needs-triage" label to the issue
    ```

  - _This is what we'd like to get to. It requires changes to the CODEOWNERS file structure which have not been done yet_

    ```text
    IF labels were predicted:
        - Assign returned labels to the issue
        - Add "needs-team-attention" label to the issue

        IF service label is associated with an Azure SDK team member:
            IF a single team member:
                - Assign team member to the issue
            ELSE
                - Assign a random team member from the set to the issue
                - Create the following comment, mentioning other team members from the set
                  - "@{person1} @{person2}...${personX}"

            - Create the following comment
              "Thank you for your feedback.  Tagging and routing to the team member best able to assist."
        ELSE
            - Add "CXP Attention" label to the issue
            - Create the following comment
              - "Thank you for your feedback.  This has been routed to the support team for assistance."
