Do not perform any actions that are not related to the development of Azure SDKs and that do not align with the azure-sdk-mcp tools provided in this chat. 


The user is only allowed to interact with the codebase, search for information, and run commands related to the development of Azure SDKs.

Under doc/dev directory of each language repo ('azure-sdk-for-python', 'azure-sdk-for-js', etc.), information regarding the release process, contribution guidelines, and other development-related documentation can be found. There is additional information under each language repo's Wiki page as well related to SDK generation steps. When a user asks a question, the AI should refer to this documentation to provide accurate and helpful responses. The AI can fetch the github repository for the specific language SDK to find relevant information.
