            "comment": "Here is a summary of the changes in this APIView:\n\n1. In the `ApiVersion` class, several new values have been added (such as `V7_2`, `V7_3`, `V7_4`, `V7_5`, and `V7_6_PREVIEW_2`) with their corresponding version strings.\n\n2. In the `DeletedSecret` class, the types of properties (`deleted_date`, `id`, `name`, `recovery_id`, and `scheduled_purge_date`) have been changed from strict types (e.g. `datetime` or `str`) to their optional variants (e.g. `Optional[datetime]` and `Optional[str]`).\n\n3. In the `KeyVaultSecret` class, the properties `id`, `name`, and `value` have been switched to optional types. Additionally, the constructor’s parameters now include explicit type annotations with `properties` typed as `SecretProperties` and `value` as `Optional[str]`.\n\n4. A new class, `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier`, has been introduced. It defines read-only properties (`name`, `source_id`, `vault_url`, and an optional `version`) and a constructor that takes a `source_id`.\n\n5. In the synchronous `SecretClient` class:\n • The constructor now specifies that `credential` is of type `TokenCredential`, and `api_version` accepts a `Union[ApiVersion, str]`. A new parameter, `verify_challenge_resource` (of type `Optional[bool]`), has also been added, and `**kwargs` is now annotated with `Any`.\n • Several methods have been updated to annotate `**kwargs` with `Any`.\n • The return type of `begin_delete_secret` has been changed from returning a `DeletedSecret` to returning a `LROPoller[DeletedSecret]`, and similarly, `begin_recover_deleted_secret` now returns a `LROPoller[SecretProperties]` instead of just `SecretProperties`.\n • A new method called `send_request` has been added. This method accepts a `request` (of type `HttpRequest`), a flag `stream` (defaulting to `False`), and `**kwargs: Any`, and it returns an `HttpResponse`.\n • In methods like `set_secret` and `update_secret_properties`, the `tags` parameter is now defined as `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`.\n\n6. In the `SecretProperties` class:\n • Many property type annotations (including `content_type`, `created_on`, `enabled`, `expires_on`, `id`, `key_id`, `name`, `not_before`, `recovery_level`, `tags`, `updated_on`, `vault_url`, and `version`) have been changed to be optional.\n • A new property, `managed: Optional[bool]`, has been added.\n • The constructor has been modified to accept variadic arguments (`*args: Any`) instead of fixed parameters, and all keyword arguments are now annotated with `Any`.\n • The `__repr__` method now explicitly specifies a return type of `str`.\n\n7. In the asynchronous module under `azure.keyvault.secrets.aio`, within the `SecretClient` class:\n • The constructor has been updated so that `api_version` now accepts a `Union[ApiVersion, str]` and includes the new `verify_challenge_resource: Optional[bool]`. The `**kwargs` are also annotated with `Any`.\n • The return types of the methods `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, and `list_properties_of_secrets` have been changed from `AsyncIterable[...]` to `AsyncItemPaged[...]`.\n • A new asynchronous method `send_request` has been added. It takes a `request` (of type `HttpRequest`), an optional `stream` flag, and `**kwargs: Any`, and it returns an `Awaitable[AsyncHttpResponse]`.\n • Methods such as `set_secret` and `update_secret_properties` have been updated to define the `tags` parameter as `Optional[Dict[str, str]]`, and any `version` parameters have been adjusted to be `Optional[str]`.\n\nThese changes introduce new API version values, adjust several property type annotations from required to optional, add new functionality via the `send_request` methods (in both sync and async clients), and update method signatures for clearer type annotations and asynchronous pagination support.",
