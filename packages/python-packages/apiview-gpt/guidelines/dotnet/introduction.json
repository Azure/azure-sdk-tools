Details of the pipeline design and usage are described in section Using HttpPipeline below. If you can't use the pipeline, you must implement [all the general requirements of Azure SDK]({{ \"/general_azurecore.html\" | relative_url }}) manually.\n\nThis document contains guidelines developed primarily for typical Azure REST services, i.e. stateless services with request-response based interaction model. Many of the guidelines in this document are more broadly applicable, but some might be specific to such REST services.\n\nAzure services are exposed to .NET developers as one or more service client types and a set of supporting types.  The supporting types may include various subclients, which give structure to the API by organizing groups of related service operations, and model types, which represent resources on the service.\n\nService clients are the main starting points for developers calling Azure services with the Azure SDK.  Each client library should have at least one client in its main namespace, so it's easy to discover.  The guidelines in this section describe patterns for the design of a service client.\n\nA service client should have the same shape as this code snippet:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace Azure.&lt;group&gt;.&lt;service_name&gt; {\n\n    // main service client class\n    public class &lt;service_name&gt;Client {\n\n        // simple constructors; don't use default parameters\n        public &lt;service_name&gt;Client(&lt;simple_binding_parameters&gt;);\n        public &lt;service_name&gt;Client(&lt;simple_binding_parameters&gt;, &lt;service_name&gt;ClientOptions options);\n\n        // 0 or more advanced constructors\n        public &lt;service_name&gt;Client(&lt;advanced_binding_parameters&gt;, &lt;service_name&gt;ClientOptions options = default);\n\n        // mocking constructor\n        protected &lt;service_name&gt;Client();\n\n        // service methods (synchronous and asynchronous)\n        public virtual Task&lt;Response&lt;&lt;model&gt;&gt; &lt;service_operation&gt;Async(&lt;parameters&gt;, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n        public virtual Response&lt;model&gt; &lt;service_operation&gt;(&lt;parameters&gt;, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n\n        // other members\n    }\n\n    // options for configuring the client\n    public class &lt;service_name&gt;ClientOptions : ClientOptions {\n\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nFor example, the Application Configuration Service client looks like this code snippet:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace Azure.Data.Configuration {\n\n    public class ConfigurationClient {\n\n        public ConfigurationClient(string connectionString);\n        public ConfigurationClient(string connectionString, ConfigurationClientOptions options);\n\n        protected ConfigurationClient(); // for mocking\n\n        public virtual Task&lt;Response&lt;&lt;ConfigurationSetting&gt;&gt; GetConfigurationSettingAsync(string key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n        public virtual Response&lt;ConfigurationSetting&gt; GetConfigurationSetting(string key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n\n        // other members\n        \u2026\n    }\n\n    // options for configuring the client\n    public class ConfigurationClientOptions : ClientOptions {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can find the full sources of here (https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/appconfiguration/Azure.Data.AppConfiguration/src/ConfigurationClient.cs) "

In [Moq] this requires using the delegate parameter to create the mock, which may not be an obvious workaround.\n\nSee Support for Mocking for details.\n\nThere are two categories of clients: service clients and their subclients. Service clients can be instantiated and have the Client suffix.  Subclients can only be created by calling factory methods on other clients (commonly on service clients) and do not have the client suffix.\n\nAs discussed above, the service client is the entry point to the API for an Azure service -- from it, library users can invoke all operations the service provides and can easily implement the most common scenarios.

A service method invoking a long running operation will return a subclass of Operation<T>, as shown below.\n\nNote that some older libraries use a slightly different, older LRO pattern. In the old pattern, LRO methods started with the prefix 'Start' and did not take the WaitUntil parameter. Such libraries are free to continue using this older pattern, or they can transition to the new pattern.\n\n```csharp\n// the following type is located in Azure.Core\npublic abstract class Operation&lt;T&gt; : Operation {\n\n    public abstract bool HasCompleted { get; }\n    public abstract bool HasValue { get; }\n\n    public abstract string Id { get; }\n\n    public abstract T Value { get; } // throws if CachedStatus != Succeeded\n    public abstract Response GetRawResponse();\n\n    public abstract Response UpdateStatus(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n    public abstract ValueTask&lt;Response&gt; UpdateStatusAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n\n    public virtual Response&lt;T&gt; WaitForCompletion(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n    public virtual Response&lt;T&gt; WaitForCompletion(TimeSpan pollingInterval, CancellationToken cancellationToken);\t\n    public virtual ValueTask&lt;Response&lt;T&gt;&gt; WaitForCompletionAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\t\n    public virtual ValueTask&lt;Response&lt;T&gt;&gt; WaitForCompletionAsync(TimeSpan pollingInterval, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n\n    // inherited  members returning untyped responses\n    public virtual Response WaitForCompletionResponse(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\t\n    public virtual Response WaitForCompletionResponse(TimeSpan pollingInterval, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\t\n    public virtual ValueTask&lt;Response&gt; WaitForCompletionResponseAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\t\n    public virtual ValueTask&lt;Response&gt; WaitForCompletionResponseAsync(TimeSpan pollingInterval, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n}\n\n```\n\nClient libraries need to inherit from Operation<T> not only to implement all abstract members, but also to provide a constructor required to access an existing LRO (an LRO initiated by a different process).\n\n```csharp\npublic class CopyFromUriOperation : Operation&lt;long&gt; {\n    public CopyFromUriOperation(string id, BlobBaseClient client);\n    ...\n}\n\npublic class BlobBaseClient {\n\n    public virtual CopyFromUriOperation CopyFromUri(WaitUntil wait, ..., CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n    public virtual Task&lt;CopyFromUriOperation&gt; CopyFromUriAsync(WaitUntil wait, ..., CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe following code snippet shows how an SDK consumer would use the Operation to poll for a response.\n\n```csharp\nBlobBaseClient client = ...\n\n// automatic polling\n{\n    Operation&lt;long&gt; operation = await client.CopyFromUri(WaitUntil.Completed, ...);\n    Console.WriteLine(operation.Value);\n}\n\n// manual polling\n{\n    CopyFromUriOperation operation = await client.CopyFromUriAsync(WaitUntil.Started, ...);\n    while (true)\n    {\n        await operation.UpdateStatusAsync();\n        if (operation.HasCompleted) break;\n        await Task.Delay(1000); // play some elevator music\n    }\n    if (operation.HasValue) Console.WriteLine(operation.Value);\n}\n\n// saving operation ID\n{\n    CopyFromUriOperation operation = await client.CopyFromUriAsync(WaitUntil.Started, ...);\n    string operationId = operation.Id;\n\n    // two days later\n    var operation2 = new CopyFromUriOperation(operationId, client);\n    long value = await operation2.WaitForCompletionAsync();\n}\n\n```"
