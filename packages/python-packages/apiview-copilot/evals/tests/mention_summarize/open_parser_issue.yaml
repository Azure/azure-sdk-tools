    "title": "[Python APIView] Literal values are not quoted in type annotations",
    "created_at": "2025-10-15T19:36:45Z",
    "body": "**Bad code snippet:**\n```python\nfoo: Literal[Foo]\n```\n\n**Description:**\nThe APIView parser is incorrectly displaying literal values in type annotations without quotes. According to Python typing conventions, literal values should be quoted, e.g., `Literal[\"Foo\"]`.\n\n**Expected (good) code snippet:**\n```python\nfoo: Literal[\"Foo\"]\n```\n\nPlease update the parser to ensure literal values are properly quoted in the APIView output.",
