# APIView for Swift

SwiftAPIView is a plugin that converts `.swift` source code to an APIView-compatible token file.

Executable Instructions:
`./SwiftAPIView --source=<PATH_TO_SOURCE> --dest=<PATH_TO_DESTINATION_FILE>`
  
  `--source`: May target a folder or a single file.
  
  `--dest`:  (Optional) The path and desired JSON filename. If not provided, it will output as `SwiftAPIView.json` inside your documents directory.
