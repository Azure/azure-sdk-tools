            "comment": "### API Summary\n\n**Purpose**  \nThis API provides a service for managing secrets within Azure Key Vault. It is designed to handle the full lifecycle of secrets, offering CRUD functionality along with operations such as backup, restore, deletion, and recovery, thereby enabling secure and efficient secret management.\n\n**API Version**  \nThe API utilizes an `ApiVersion` enumeration to manage versioning. The latest version available is `V7_7_preview_1`, which represents the current iteration of the service.\n\n**Client Classes**  \nThe API exposes two primary client classes: a synchronous `SecretClient` and an asynchronous `SecretClient` available under the asynchronous module. Both of these clients provide equivalent functionality, tailored to their respective execution models, allowing architects to choose the appropriate client based on application requirements.\n\n**Functional Overview**  \nBoth the synchronous and asynchronous `SecretClient` classes offer methods that encapsulate the essential functionality needed for complete secret management—enabling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of secrets. In addition, they include operations for backing up and restoring secrets, handling long-running deletion and recovery processes, and managing secret lifecycle policies. The clients also support context management to ensure that connections and resources are properly maintained and disposed of during their usage.",
