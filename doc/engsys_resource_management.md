## Resource Management Guidelines

This document contains guidelines for creating and managing Azure resources in the Azure SDK
subscriptions. EngSys has automation that will delete resources based on the criteria outlined below. This is to
improve our overall security risks and manage costs.

     * [Resource Groups](#resource-groups)
        * [Quick Start Creating Resources](#quick-start-creating-resources)

## Managing Development and Testing Resources

The cleanup script implementing these guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/eng/scripts/live-test-resource-cleanup.ps1).

This section applies to resource groups located in any of the dev/test subscriptions managed by the Azure SDK
Engineering System team, such as:

- Azure SDK Developer Playground
- Azure SDK Test Resources
- Azure SDK Test Resources - Preview
- Sovereign cloud test subscriptions

Currently, the automation will inspect resource groups and role assignments only.

### Resource Groups

**NOTE:** Development resources should only be created in the `Azure SDK Developer Playground` subscription. The other
subscriptions are intended to be used for CI resources and not manual testing.

#### Quick Start Creating Resources

*To create temporary resources for testing:*

Create a resource group to contain all testing resources. The resource group will be deleted after approximately 24-28 hours.
If you need the group for a little more time, add/update a tag named `DeleteAfter` with a new date by running the below powershell script:

```
./eng/common/TestResources/Update-TestResources.ps1 -ResourceGroupName <rg name> -DeleteAfterHours 120
```

*To create long-lived resources:*

Create a resource group to contain all testing resources. The resource group name should start with your Microsoft alias.
Valid group name examples: `myalias`, `myalias-feature-101-testing`. Your Microsoft account must be
[linked to your Github account](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/link).

```
New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName myalias-feature-101-testing -Location centralus
# Run live tests with pre-allocated resource group
./eng/common/TestResources/New-TestResources.ps1 <service directory> -ResourceGroupName myalias-feature-101-testing -Location centralus
```

#### Full Resource Management Specification

The automation will delete all resource groups in managed subscriptions multiple times DAILY, unless they meet at least one of the following criteria:

- The resource group starts with a valid alias (see alias [rules](#alias-rules)), followed by an optional hyphen and extra characters.
    - Valid resource group name examples: `myalias`, `myalias-test-foobar` for `myalias@microsoft.com` or `github.com/myalias`
- The resource group contains a tag with the name `Owners` where the value is a csv formatted string that contains at
  least one valid Microsoft or Github alias (see alias [rules](#alias-rules)).
    - This convention should only be used when it is not possible to name the resource group with an alias
        (for example, inner groups auto-created by a resource provider like AKS).
    - Valid owner tag examples: `Owners: myalias`, `Owners: myalias,anotheralias,lastalias`
- The resource group contains a tag with the name `DeleteAfter` and an [ISO8601 formatted date value](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)
  (see below for examples), where the date is greater than the current date.
    - If the `DeleteAfter` value is in the past at the time the cleanup pipeline runs, it will be deleted.
      The cleanup pipeline runs multiple times daily, starting at 12am pacific time (UTC-8). See the [schedule](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_apps/hub/ms.vss-ciworkflow.build-ci-hub?_a=edit-build-definition&id=1357&view=Tab_Triggers).
    - If you have a resource group for which you would like to extend the lifetime, update the `DeleteAfter` tag to a
      future date to renew the lease.
    - Valid date tag format: `DeleteAfter: 2022-01-29T00:35:48.9372617Z`
      Example extending resource group lease by three days:
      ```
      # Test Resources Script
      # Update default resource group created via New-TestResources.ps1 and a default DeleteAfter of 48 hours.
      ./eng/common/TestResources/Update-TestResources.ps1
      # Update custom resource group name and/or custom DeleteAfter hours value (max 168).
      ./eng/common/TestResources/Update-TestResources.ps1 -ResourceGroupName <rg name> -DeleteAfterHours 120

      # azure powershell, set manually
      Set-AzResourceGroup -Name <group name> -Tag @{ DeleteAfter = [DateTime]::UtcNow.AddDays(3).ToString("o") }

      # azure cli, set manually
      az group update -g <group name> --tags DeleteAfter=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" -d "$(date) + 3 day")
      ```
- The resource group contains a tag with the name `DoNotDelete` and any value (even empty).
    - Even if this tag is set, the `Owners` tag should still be set for tracking.
    - This should only be used for resources that must never be deleted, in case all owners leave the company.

Resource groups which do not satisfy at least one of the above criteria will have a `DeleteAfter` tag added for a 24 hour duration to mark them for deletion and give any test pipelines that are actively using the resources time to complete.

**NOTE:** For long-lived resources, please also add a resource group tag named `Purpose` describing the purpose of the group.

#### Alias Rules

Due to permissions limitations with querying the Microsoft Graph API with an AAD application, alias lookups are
performed by querying the https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/ API for github->microsoft alias mappings.
The implications of this are:

- Mail/Security group aliases are not supported, only aliases for individuals will be recognized.
- If using a Microsoft alias, it must be linked with a Github account in order to be recognized. See [docs on linking an account](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/link).

For example, for a Microsoft account of foobarmsft@microsoft.com linked to a github account of foobar, the following
will be treated as valid by the cleanup scripts:

- foobarmsft  (Microsoft alias)
- foobar@microsoft.com  (Microsoft User Principal Name)
- foobar  (Github username)

### Role Assignments

Role assignments should be created at the resource group scope or below, where the resource group follows the above
guidelines. Subscription-level role assignments may be deleted at any time. Reach out to the EngSys team for exemptions.
