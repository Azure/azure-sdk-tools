## Version 0.2.10 (2022-03-09)
Added support for TypedDict classes.
Added support to parse defaults from docstrings. Example
  syntax: "A value, defaults to foo."
  Also supports older, non-recommended syntax, such as:
  "A value. Default value is foo."

  parameter to supply the necessary mapping file.
Fixed issue where required keyword-only arguments displayed as optional.

## Version 0.2.9 (Unreleased)
Fixed issue where Python 3-style type hints stopped displaying
  their inner types.
Fixed issue where docstring annotations were preferred over
  Python 2-style type hints for return types. Since docstrings
  have a 2-line limit, this preference didn't make sense.
Fixed issue where too many blank lines were generated.

## Version 0.2.8 (Unreleased)
Kwargs that were previously displayed as "type = ..." will now
  be displayed as "Optional[type] = ..." to align with syntax
