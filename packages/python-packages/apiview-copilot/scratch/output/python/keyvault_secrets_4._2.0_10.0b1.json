            "comment": "Here is a summary of the changes in this APIView:\n\n1. In the `ApiVersion` enum, several new version values have been added: `V7_2`, `V7_3`, `V7_4`, `V7_5`, and `V7_6_PREVIEW_2`.\n\n2. In the `DeletedSecret` class, the properties `deleted_date`, `id`, `name`, `recovery_id`, and `scheduled_purge_date` now have their types marked as optional (e.g. using `Optional[datetime]` and `Optional[str]`), whereas they were previously non-optional.\n\n3. In the `KeyVaultSecret` class, the properties `id`, `name`, and `value` have been updated to use optional types. Additionally, the initializer’s parameters now include explicit type annotations with `properties: SecretProperties` and `value: Optional[str]`.\n\n4. A new class, `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier`, has been introduced. It defines the read-only properties `name`, `source_id`, and `vault_url` as strings, with `version` as an optional string, and includes an initializer that takes a `source_id` parameter.\n\n5. In the `SecretClient` class:\n   - The `__init__` method now explicitly types the `credential` parameter as `TokenCredential`, changes the type of the `api_version` parameter to `Union[ApiVersion, str]`, and adds a new parameter `verify_challenge_resource` of type `Optional[bool]`. The variadic keyword arguments are now annotated as `**kwargs: Any`.\n   - Several methods have been updated to annotate `**kwargs` as `Any`. For example, the `backup_secret`, `get_deleted_secret`, `get_secret`, and others now clearly specify `**kwargs: Any` in their signatures.\n   - The return type of `begin_delete_secret` has been changed from `DeletedSecret` to `LROPoller[DeletedSecret]`, and similarly, `begin_recover_deleted_secret` now returns `LROPoller[SecretProperties]`.\n   - In `set_secret` and `update_secret_properties`, the `tags` parameter has been updated to be of type `Optional[Dict[str, str]]` instead of a direct dictionary.\n   - A new method named `send_request` has been added. This method accepts a `request: HttpRequest`, a keyword-only parameter `stream: bool` with a default of `False`, and `**kwargs: Any`, with a return type of `HttpResponse`.\n\n6. In the `SecretProperties` class:\n   - Multiple properties (`content_type`, `created_on`, `enabled`, `expires_on`, `id`, `key_id`, `name`, and `not_before`) have been changed to have optional types.\n   - A new property `managed` of type `Optional[bool]` has been added.\n   - Other properties such as `recovery_level`, `tags`, `updated_on`, `vault_url`, and `version` have also been updated to be optional.\n   - The constructor signature now accepts `*args: Any` and `**kwargs: Any`, and the return type annotation for `__repr__` has been explicitly set to `str`.\n\n7. In the asynchronous version (in the `azure.keyvault.secrets.aio` namespace):\n   - The `SecretClient` class’s initializer now uses `credential: AsyncTokenCredential`, with similar changes to `api_version` (now `Union[ApiVersion, str]`) and the addition of the `verify_challenge_resource` parameter.\n   - Methods that list secrets (such as `list_deleted_secrets`, `list_properties_of_secret_versions`, and `list_properties_of_secrets`) have changed their return types from `AsyncIterable[...]` to `AsyncItemPaged[...]` for better paging support.\n   - A new asynchronous method `send_request` has been added with a similar signature to its synchronous counterpart but returns `Awaitable[AsyncHttpResponse]`.\n\nOverall, the diff primarily introduces additional API version options, standardizes the use of optional type annotations across various models, refines method signatures with improved type hints (including for variadic keyword arguments), updates return types for long-running operations, and adds a new helper method (`send_request`) in both synchronous and asynchronous clients.",
