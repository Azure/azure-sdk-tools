I tried adding them but other than java and .NET, i'm unable to find in the dropdowns the Device Registry sdk packages (Go, Python, JS). Typing in the dropdowns doesn't do anything. Meanwhile, I confirm that our sdks exist:\nJS: Release @azure/arm-deviceregistry_1.0.0 · Azure/azure-sdk-for-js\ngo: azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/deviceregistry at main · Azure/azure-sdk-for-go\npython: azure-sdk-for-python/sdk/deviceregistry at main · Azure/azure-sdk-for-python\nIf someone knows how to resolve this, please let me know. thank you!",
            "inputs.ground_truth": "They are all ready. Mariana Rios had to update information in our end to recognize the package",
            "inputs.response": "The issue where Device Registry SDK packages for Go, Python, and JavaScript are not appearing in the SDK release planner dropdowns—despite being present in the language repos—typically indicates that the release planner tool sources its selectable package list from metadata tracked in the Azure SDK engineering system. Specifically, the release planner uses metadata from the public repo (e.g., CSV files in azure-sdk/_data/releases/latest/) and internal release work items to generate its list.\n\nTo resolve this and make your packages selectable:\n1. Ensure that your SDK packages are properly tracked in the Azure SDK release work items. You should run the Prepare-Release.ps1 script to mark the release status of each package and ensure all relevant fields (Service Name, Package Display Name, etc.) are filled out. This data is used to populate dropdowns and tables in the release planner.\n2. Verify that the metadata CSV files for each language include entries for your Device Registry packages with correct information (Package name, Service name, DisplayName, SdkType, etc.). If the metadata is missing or incorrect, the packages will not show up in planner dropdowns.\n3. After updating or correcting metadata, allow time for the automation job to run (every 2 hours during business hours) or manually trigger it to update the planner UI.\n4. Double-check the release plan summary and milestone details to confirm the packages are now selectable.\n\nActionable next steps:\n- Run Prepare-Release.ps1 and ensure metadata is present and correct for all target packages.\n- If you find anything unexpected in the planner or the docs, check and update the metadata CSV file, then manually trigger the automation job if needed.\n- Refer to the onboarding documentation for the required metadata fields and troubleshooting steps.\n\nIf issues persist, you can reach out to the Azure SDK Release Support channel for further assistance.",

You'll need to\\r\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\r\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\r\\n*before* releasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\r\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\r\\n\\r\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays.

Specifically, the release planner uses metadata from the public repo (e.g., CSV files in azure-sdk/_data/releases/latest/) and internal release work items to generate its list.\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this and make your packages selectable:\\\\n1. Ensure that your SDK packages are properly tracked in the Azure SDK release work items. You should run the Prepare-Release.ps1 script to mark the release status of each package and ensure all relevant fields (Service Name, Package Display Name, etc.) are filled out. This data is used to populate dropdowns and tables in the release planner.\\\\n2. Verify that the metadata CSV files for each language include entries for your Device Registry packages with correct information (Package name, Service name, DisplayName, SdkType, etc.). If the metadata is missing or incorrect, the packages will not show up in planner dropdowns.\\\\n3. After updating or correcting metadata, allow time for the automation job to run (every 2 hours during business hours) or manually trigger it to update the planner UI.\\\\n4. Double-check the release plan summary and milestone details to confirm the packages are now selectable.\\\\n\\\\nActionable next steps:\\\\n- Run Prepare-Release.ps1 and ensure metadata is present and correct for all target packages.\\\\n- If you find anything unexpected in the planner or the docs, check and update the metadata CSV file, then manually trigger the automation job if needed.\\\\n- Refer to the onboarding documentation for the required metadata fields and troubleshooting steps.\\\\n\\\\nIf issues persist, you can reach out to the Azure SDK Release Support channel for further assistance.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"They are all ready.

            "inputs.response": "To update the SDK version information in the Azure SDK Release Planner for Python, JavaScript, and Go, you need to ensure that the metadata in the release work items and the relevant CSV files are accurate. The Release Planner and the documentation system rely on the metadata from these sources to display correct version information for each language. \n\n**Action Steps:**\n1. Update the release work items for your SDKs using the Prepare-Release.ps1 script to ensure the correct version is reflected for each language (Python, JavaScript, Go). This script updates the metadata that Release Planner uses to track versions.\n2. If your package has already been released or the changelog/metadata is not updated, check the corresponding metadata CSV file (for example, `python-packages.csv`, `js-packages.csv`, `go-packages.csv`) located in `azure-sdk/_data/releases/latest/` in the Azure SDK repo. Update the `VersionGA` and/or `VersionPreview` fields to match the desired version (e.g., 1.1.0 for Python/JavaScript, 2.0.0 for Go).\n3. After updating, commit your changes and create a PR. Once merged, the Release Planner and documentation site will reflect the updated versions.\n4. For tracking progress and verifying the update, use the Release Planner summary and milestones views.\n\nIf you encounter issues with the Release Planner not updating after these changes, report a bug directly in Release Planner or reach out to the Azure SDK Onboarding channel for support.\n\n**References:**\n- You can find more information about updating metadata and troubleshooting automated documentation updates in the onboarding and release docs.\n- The changelog should be kept up to date before initiating release pipelines, as it affects automated version tracking.\n\nFor additional help, see the guidance below or contact the Azure SDK Onboarding channel.",

It will guide you through the process of getting\\r\\nyour PR reviewed and inform you how to determine if your PR is on the correct review queue and if so, where it is on it.\\n\\n### The pull request I created at azure-rest-api-specs[-pr] fails validation, what to do?\\n\\nCarefully follow the guidance provided in the PR description and in the `Next Steps to Merge` comment added to it\\r\\nby the automation.\\n\\n### I believe the validation tooling is wrong; it reports a problem where there is none\\n\\nCarefully follow the guidance provided in the PR description and in the `Next Steps to Merge` comment added to it\\r\\nby the automation. It covers cases where the tooling is faulty and/or reporting false positives.\\n\\n### I have a question about, or issue with ShiftLeft pipeline (aka API spec pipeline)\\n\\nIf your issue concerns ShiftLeft, be aware that:\\r\\n- As of April 2023 we are not onboarding anybody else onto ShiftLeft pipeline.\\r\\n- We do not provide support for anyone who is already onboarded onto ShiftLeft.\\r\\n- If ShiftLeft pipeline is broken for you, we recommend stopping using it. As a replacement, you can\\r\\nopen PRs directly against the relevant specs repositories. See [this article](xref:api-specs-pr).\\r\\n  - Eventually we will provide proper replacement for ShiftLeft.\\r\\nIf you still need help in maintaining existing legacy ShiftLeft setup, consult the  \\r\\n[unmaintained, deprecated, legacy docs](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/611/API-First-with-Service-API-Toolset).\\n\\n### I need help with ARM review for my PR\\n\\nPlease see [Get your PR reviewed by ARM](xref:pr-arm-review).\\n\\n### Why I do not see an assignee for my ARM PR?\\n\\nAs of January 2024 the spec PRs are no longer getting automatically assigned to anyone, by design.\\r\\nYour PR will still get reviewed by the ARM team if you follow the relevant process.\\r\\nFor details, please see [Get your PR reviewed by ARM](xref:pr-arm-review).\\n\\n## TypeSpec / OpenAPI specs\\n\\nThis FAQ pertains to generic questions about TypeSpec / OpenAPI specifications.

File an extension for the Management/Data plane API \\u0026 Beta SDK release readiness KPI in S360 and provide justification for your decision in the request, see [Request an exception for Azure SDKs](xref:request-exception).\\r\\n2. Create a release plan to generate and release beta SDKs from a stable API version, wait 30 days after release to proceed to the next steps to see if there are any issues with the SDKs.\\r\\n3. If no API or SDK issues are reported, update the SDK version from beta to GA in each language SDK repo and update the respective change log. Create a GA release plan and email sdkowners@microsoft.com to inform them that you are going to convert your beta SDKs to Stable and that you don't have any changes to  make to the SDK.\\r\\n4. If API or SDK issues are identified, create a GA release plan and follow the release plan process as normal.\\n\\n### Release of a package failed, now do I retry?\\n\\nPackage releases can be retried by clicking the **Rerun failed jobs** button of the release pipeline.\\n\\n### I accidentally published a package, how can I delete it?\\n\\nThis is generally not possible. Most package registries enforce immutability to ensure the integrity of the developer\\r\\necosystem they support. If you need to republish a package you must increment the version number as appropriate and republish.\\r\\nMost registries allow you to delist packages but not completely remove them\\r\\n(sometimes exceptions are made fro actively malicious packages).\\n\\n### How do I generate an SDK during private preview using MCP?\\n\\nSDK generation is not required for private preview. If you choose to provide SDKs early, follow this process:\\r\\n1. Create a Private Preview Release Plan\\r\\nGo to https://aka.ms/release-planner-preview.\\r\\nSelect Private Preview as the release type.\\r\\nAdd your API spec PR link (from azure-rest-api-specs-pr).\\r\\nComplete API readiness milestones.\\r\\n2. Clone the Private API Spec Repo (https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr) and the Private SDK Language repos (e.g. https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python-pr) to your local environment.\\r\\n3. Set Up MCP Server\\r\\nInstall MCP tools in VS Code: aka.ms/azsdk/agent\\r\\n4. SDK via MCP\\r\\nUse MCP commands in VS Code Agent Mode - Example: \\r\\n  Generate SDK for [service-name] in [language].\\r\\n5. Share SDK for Internal Use (Optional)\\r\\nThe Azure SDK Team does not support publishing SDK PRs to public repos for private specs, and there is no formal release process for private preview SDKs. If you need internal distribution:Keep SDK changes in a feature branch within the private SDK repo and publish to a private Azure DevOps feed. Do not merge to main because it mirrors the public repo.\\n\\n## General\\n\\nThis FAQ pertains to various questions that do not fall within any of the other FAQs. This includes questions about:\\r\\n- TypeSpec (previously CADL)\\r\\n- Live Validation tool\\n\\n### I was told about CADL, but not TypeSpec, what is the difference?\\n\\nCADL is an obsolete name for TypeSpec. TypeSpec is the official public name since February 2023.\\n\\n### I'm used to generating my SDKs with AutoRest, and with the latest version I do not see any model generated anymore. Where are my models, and how can I generate them?\\n\\n[AutoRest] is a product that was originally designed to be wrapped entirely by a manual layer of code.\\r\\nThe new approach taken with next generation of codegen, called DPG (Data Plane Generator),\\r\\nallows generated code to ship directly with no wrapper.\\r\\nHowever, generating shippable models from\\r\\nOpenAPI specs creates many challenges as OpenAPI spec standard is a poor source of information for versioning\\r\\nand typing information.\\r\\nTherefore, we are moving to TypeSpec for model generation. This means today:\\r\\n- Generation from OpenAPI specs will generate clients and protocol methods only\\r\\n- Generation from TypeSpec will generate clients, protocol methods, typed methods (a.k.a. convenience methods) and models\\n\\n### I am having some issues with my SDK's reference documentation publication\\n\\n\\u003c!-- TODO: the answer to this question needs o be updated. --\\u003e\\r\\nSee [Package Onboarding step-by-step](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/602/Package-Onboarding-step-by-step).\\n\\n### I need help with Live Validation\\n\\nReach out to the [Service API Toolset Teams channel] for help.\\r\\nIn your post, describe the issue and include links to the artifacts that are applicable to your problem. For example:\\r\\n- Pull request\\r\\n- Build log\\r\\n- Failing check\\n\\n### I have a S360 KPI issue saying `Linter Validation Error Details`\\n\\nIf you have a problem that says `Linter Validation Error Details` and `S360 KPI`, fill out\\r\\nthe `Swagger Validation Feedback` feedback form link that is provided within.\\n\\n### Is there a separate process that has to be followed for CLI, PowerShell, and Terraform updates or is it part of the SDK release plan?\\n\\nNo, CLI updates are not part of the SDK release. For information relevant to CLI, PowerShell, or Terraform please\\r\\nreview instructions here:  [aka.ms/azureclitools/](https://aka.ms/azureclitools/onboarding)\\r\\n[AutoRest]: https://github.com/Azure/autorest\\r\\n[Azure API Stewardship Board General Channel]: https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a3ebb18fded0e47938f998e196a52952f%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=1a10b50c-e870-4fe0-8483-bf5542a8d2d8\\u0026tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47\\r\\n[Service API Toolset Teams channel]: https://aka.ms/azsdk/support/spectools-channel\"},{\"document_source\":\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\",\"document_filename\":\"develop#sdk-docs.md\",\"document_title\":\"Publish SDK reference docs\",\"document_link\":\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/develop/sdk-docs\",\"content\":\"# develop#sdk-docs.md\\n\\n# Publish SDK reference docs\\n\\n## Before you begin\\n\\n- You have [access](xref:access) to the GitHub repositories and respective GitHub groups.\\r\\nbe added to the [azure-sdk-write](https://github.com/orgs/MicrosoftDocs/teams/azure-sdk-write) GitHub group.

Builds generate docs for all packages onboarded, run on\\r\\na schedule, and take several hours to complete. Changes can be viewed on the reference review site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e Note: Android reference docs are not yet supported on Microsoft Learn. You will need to follow the [Android guidelines](./sdk-android-docs.md)\\r\\n\\u003e for publishing said documentation instead.\\n\\n### Packages released through the Azure SDK engineering system\\n\\nduring business hours on weekdays.

If the metadata is not correct, open a PR with corrections.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce merged your changes will be released on the next available documentation release.\\r\\n\\r\\n##### Update a published Package-level Overview\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e For packages released using the Azure SDK EngSys, changes need to be synchronized between the source SDK repo and the docs\\r\\n\\u003e repo. Changes to the docs repo that are not mirrored to the source SDK repo will be overwritten by content from the source\\r\\n\\u003e SDK repo on the next package release.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Find the Package-level overview using the table from [Package-level overviews](#package-level-overviews).\\r\\n2. Find the corresponding README.md file for the library in the SDK repo (e.g. [azure-sdk-for-net](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net)).\\r\\n3. Update the \\\"front matter\\\" date field at the beginning of the file to today's date. To update other front matter metadata, see [Ensure CSV metadata is correct](#ensure-csv-metadata-is-correct).\\r\\n4. Copy changed content from step 2 into the Package-level overview from step 1.\\r\\n5. Open a pull request for the update file in the docs repo\\n\\nIf your package is released through the Azure SDK engineering system, almost everything is automated. You'll need to\\r\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\r\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\r\\n*before* releasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\r\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\r\\n\\r\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays. If your data is\\r\\nnot updated and you don't want to wait, [run the job manually](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=1284).\\r\\nThis will update the metadata PR.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find anything unexpected in the table of contents or service README, check the\\r\\n[metadata CSV file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/tree/main/_data/releases/latest) to ensure that the metadata is\\r\\ncorrect. If the metadata is not correct, open a PR with corrections.\\n\\n### Packages released outside the Azure SDK engineering system\\n\\n- **ServiceDirectory** -- Name of the service (e.g. `storage`).\\r\\n- **DirectoryPath** -- Path from the root of the `azure-sdk-for-*` repo to the package. If unknown or the package is not released from an `azure-sdk-for-*` repo, use the value `\\\"\\\"`\\r\\n- **SdkType** -- Use values `client` or `mgmt` to place the package in the appropriate location in the table of contents.\\r\\n- **IsNewSdk** -- Use `true` if the package is a track 2 SDK, otherwise use `false`.\\r\\n- **Group** -- Required *only for Java*\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace the metadata JSON file in the `metadata/\\u003cmoniker\\u003e` folder with the name of the package. For example, the metadata\\r\\nJSON file for the `Azure.Storage.Blobs` package would be named\\r\\n[`Azure.Storage.Blobs.json`](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/metadata/latest/Azure.Storage.Blobs.json).\\r\\nFor Java packages, name the file for the artifact and omit the group ID (e.g.\\r\\n[`azure-storage-blob.json`](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-java/blob/main/metadata/latest/azure-storage-blob.json)).\\r\\n\\r\\n|  | .NET | Java | JS | Python |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| Metadata Location | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/metadata) | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-java/tree/main/metadata) | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-node/tree/main/metadata) | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/tree/main/metadata) |\\n\\nFor more information on CSV fields, see: [metadata CSV readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca id=\\\"service-level-overview\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Service-level overviews \\r\\n\\r\\nService-level overviews provide a list of relevant packages. Service-level overview pages are generated automatically\\r\\nfor each service and contain a list of packages.\\r\\n\\r\\nService teams can create their own service-level overview pages which contain more information. Service teams that\\r\\ncreate their own service-level overview pages are responsible for updating those pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create a service-level overview page, look for the relevant markdown for your service. Service-level markdown files\\r\\nare named in the format `service-name.md` where spaces are replaced with dashes (`-`). For example the service-level\\r\\noverview for the `Key Vault` service would be named `key-vault.md`.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn `[!INCLUDE]` directive can be used to include a list of packages which will be automatically updated as metadata\\r\\nabout new packages is available.\\r\\n\\r\\n```md\\r\\n[!INCLUDE [packages](advisor-index.md)]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of packages is in a file whose name is of the form `\\u003cservice\\u003e-index.md`.\\r\\n\\r\\nService-level overview examples:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Custom service-level overview requiring manual edits: [Python Storage](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/blob/main/docs-ref-services/latest/storage.md)\\r\\n- Service-level overview generated automatically: [Python Advisor](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/blob/main/docs-ref-services/latest/advisor.md)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca id=\\\"package-level-overview\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Package-level overviews\\r\\n\\r\\nPackage level overviews are generated from the README.md file in the package source as part of the\\r\\nrelease process.

Go to our [pipelines hub](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?view=pipelines\\u0026option=recent) contained\\r\\nwithin the _internal_ team project.\\r\\n1. Select **All** to see all the pipelines aggregated by language folders.\\r\\n1. Per language, you will need to locate and select the pipeline that is used to build your package.\\r\\nPipelines are named after the language and service area that they are responsible for building and releasing.\\r\\nFor example the _core_ libraries are named **java - core**, and the app configuration libraries are named **java - appconfiguration**.\\r\\n1.

However, if you want to build a specific commit or branch, add the\\r\\ncommit hash or branch name in the **Commit** field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!IMPORTANT]\\r\\n\\u003e Before running the build pipeline, make sure that your Core dependency (and any other inter-library dependency)\\r\\n\\u003e is correct for the current release.\\n\\n### Wait for signing\\n\\nOnce the pipeline started it will display a progress screen. Because releasing a package is a multi-stage process,\\r\\nwe first build the package from scratch again, then sign the package. Wait until this step is completed.\\n\\n### Inspect the package\\n\\n1. Click on the **Artifacts** generated by the pipeline.\\r\\n1. Select **packages-signed**.\\r\\n1. Select each package you want to release and download it.\\r\\n1. Spot check version and package name and inspect and/or test the package.

The release planner says version 1.0.0 for our python sdk. however, that was our last GA release version, and our generated PR changelog shows it is actually 1.1.0 version we want to release. is there a way to change this version in our release planner? thanks\\\\njavascript is also incorrect version:  (should be 1.1.0) and Go sdk is blank when it should be 2.0.0 from changelog:\\\\n```\\\\n```\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"To update the SDK version information in the Azure SDK Release Planner for Python, JavaScript, and Go, you need to ensure that the metadata in the release work items and the relevant CSV files are accurate. The Release Planner and the documentation system rely on the metadata from these sources to display correct version information for each language. \\\\n\\\\n**Action Steps:**\\\\n1. Update the release work items for your SDKs using the Prepare-Release.ps1 script to ensure the correct version is reflected for each language (Python, JavaScript, Go). This script updates the metadata that Release Planner uses to track versions.\\\\n2. If your package has already been released or the changelog/metadata is not updated, check the corresponding metadata CSV file (for example, `python-packages.csv`, `js-packages.csv`, `go-packages.csv`) located in `azure-sdk/_data/releases/latest/` in the Azure SDK repo. Update the `VersionGA` and/or `VersionPreview` fields to match the desired version (e.g., 1.1.0 for Python/JavaScript, 2.0.0 for Go).\\\\n3. After updating, commit your changes and create a PR. Once merged, the Release Planner and documentation site will reflect the updated versions.\\\\n4. For tracking progress and verifying the update, use the Release Planner summary and milestones views.\\\\n\\\\nIf you encounter issues with the Release Planner not updating after these changes, report a bug directly in Release Planner or reach out to the Azure SDK Onboarding channel for support.\\\\n\\\\n**References:**\\\\n- You can find more information about updating metadata and troubleshooting automated documentation updates in the onboarding and release docs.\\\\n- The changelog should be kept up to date before initiating release pipelines, as it affects automated version tracking.\\\\n\\\\nFor additional help, see the guidance below or contact the Azure SDK Onboarding channel.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"the version of the packages reflects what currently exists on main on the languages repo,because your PR hasn't been merged, you are seeing the previous version,.NET was already merged, so you see the right version.\\\"}\"}]",

            "inputs.response": "Based on your description and the provided build logs, the SDK Validation - .NET errors (CS0122: 'GeneratorPageableHelpers' is inaccessible due to its protection level) are caused by the generated C# code attempting to use the 'GeneratorPageableHelpers' class, which is not publicly accessible in the generated SDK. This issue typically arises from one of the following:\n\n1. The TypeSpec C# emitter (@azure-tools/typespec-csharp) or its dependencies are out of date and do not match the expected helper accessibility.\n2. Your tspconfig.yaml does not have the required configuration for management plane generation, resulting in incompatible or missing code stubs.\n3. There is a known issue in the C# generator that needs to be resolved by updating the generator package or adjusting your configuration.\n\n**How to resolve:**\n\n- **Update your dependencies:**\n  Ensure that your `package.json` contains the latest version of `@azure-tools/typespec-csharp`. Run `tsp install` to refresh dependencies.\n  \n- **Check tspconfig.yaml configuration:**\n  For a management plane SDK, your tspconfig.yaml should include the following emitter options:\n\n  ```yaml\n  emit:\n    - \"@azure-tools/typespec-csharp\"\n  options:\n    \"@azure-tools/typespec-csharp\":\n      flavor: azure\n      package-dir: \"Azure.ResourceManager.Genome\"\n      clear-output-folder: true\n      model-namespace: true\n      namespace: \"{package-dir}\"\n  ```\n\n  Reference the [Contoso.Management sample tspconfig.yaml](https://aka.ms/azsdk/tspconfig-sample-mpg) for exact option usage.\n\n- **Re-run code generation:**\n  After updating your config and dependencies, run:\n  ```bash\n  tsp compile path/to/main.tsp\n  ```\n  and ensure the generated code does not reference inaccessible helpers.\n\n- **If the issue persists:**\n  This may be a regression or a bug in the generator. Reach out to the .NET Teams channel for help:\n  [.NET Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7b87fb348f224b37b6206fa9d89a105b%40thread.skype/Language%2520-%2520DotNet?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)\n  Provide your PR link and details of the error.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Update your TypeSpec C# emitter to the latest version.\n- Ensure tspconfig.yaml matches the management plane sample configuration.\n- Re-run code generation and build.\n- If unresolved, contact the .NET Teams channel with your PR and error details.\n\nThis approach is aligned with the Azure SDK engineering and TypeSpec guidance for .NET SDK validation issues.",

Once the package.json and tspconfig.yaml files are updated, you need to install all required dependencies by running the following command in the project root:\\r\\n\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   tsp install\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Run the emitter to compile your TypeScript code into the desired language. Use the following command to trigger the emitter and compile your project:\\r\\n\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   tsp compile {path to main.tsp}/main.tsp\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003c/Steps\\u003e\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\n\\n\\u003cAside\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n**All client emitters are in preview**.

The TypeSpec compiler copies from source to destination.  In our sample: \\r\\n* source\\r\\n  * https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/contosowidgetmanager/Contoso.Management/examples/2021-10-01-preview \\r\\n* destination\\r\\n  * https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/contosowidgetmanager/resource-manager/Microsoft.Contoso/preview/2021-10-01-preview/examples\\r\\nIf you are changing examples, you must **first** change the copy under your TypeSpec folder, and then run `tsp compile` (or `tsv` which calls `compile`) to update the copies in your Swagger folder.\\n\\n# Validation Rule Suppression\\n\\nYou can suppress specific validation rules within `TypeSpecValidation` by creating or modifying a `suppressions.yaml` file in the root directory of your service specification.\\r\\n\\u003e **Note:** Currently, only the `SdkTspConfigValidation` rule supports suppression.\\n\\n## Suppressing SdkTspConfigValidation Rules\\n\\nThe `SdkTspConfigValidation` rule is responsible for validating emitter options and parameters defined in your `tspconfig.yaml` file. You have the flexibility to suppress this rule entirely or target specific sub-rules within it.\\n\\n### Suppress the Entire SdkTspConfigValidation Rule\\n\\nIf you need to skip **all** validation checks for emitter options and parameters within a particular `tspconfig.yaml` file, you can suppress the entire `SdkTspConfigValidation` rule.\\r\\nTo do this, add or update the `suppressions.yaml` file in your service's root folder with the following content:\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\r\\n  paths:\\r\\n    # Specify the path to the tspconfig.yaml file where suppression should apply\\r\\n    - /path/to/tspconfig.yaml\\r\\n  rules:\\r\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\r\\n  reason: the-reason-you-want-to-suppress # Explain why this suppression is necessary\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Suppress Specific Sub-rules within SdkTspConfigValidation\\n\\nIf you only need to bypass validation for **specific** emitter options or parameters, you can suppress individual sub-rules.\\r\\nAdd or update your `suppressions.yaml` file with the following structure, specifying the sub-rules to ignore:\\r\\nSub-rule Syntax:\\r\\n- For parameters: `parameters.\\u003cparameter-key\\u003e.default`\\r\\n- For emitter options: `options.\\u003cemitter-name\\u003e.\\u003coption-key\\u003e`\\r\\n- For nested options (e.g., `package-details: name: \\\"xxx\\\"`), use dot notation: `options.\\u003cemitter-name\\u003e.package-details.name`\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n- tool: TypeSpecValidation\\r\\n  paths:\\r\\n    # Specify the path to the tspconfig.yaml file where suppression should apply\\r\\n    - /path/to/tspconfig.yaml\\r\\n  rules:\\r\\n    - SdkTspConfigValidation\\r\\n  sub-rules:\\r\\n    # Example: Suppress validation for a specific parameter's default value\\r\\n    - parameters.\\u003ckey-to-validate\\u003e.default \\r\\n    # Example: Suppress validation for a specific emitter option\\r\\n    - options.\\u003cemitter-name\\u003e.\\u003ckey-to-validate\\u003e\\r\\n    # Example: Suppress validation for a nested emitter option\\r\\n    - options.\\u003cemitter-name\\u003e.package-details.name \\r\\n  reason: the-reason-you-want-to-suppress # Explain why this suppression is necessary\\r\\n```\\n\\n# Rules\\n\\n## SdkTspConfigValidation\\n\\n### Parameters\\n\\n- **`parameters.default.service-dir`**\\r\\n  - Allowed values: strings that matches the regex `/^sdk\\\\/.*$/`\\r\\n  - example: `sdk/aaa`\\n\\n### JavaScript Sub Rules\\n\\nPlane\\r\\n- [**`@azure-tools/typespec-ts.options.package-dir`**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/contosowidgetmanager/Contoso.WidgetManager/tspconfig.yaml#L33)\\r\\n  - Allowed values: strings that matches the regex `/^(?:[a-z]+-)+rest$/`\\r\\n  - example: `arm-aaa-rest`\\r\\n- [**`@azure-tools/typespec-ts.options.package-details.name`**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/contosowidgetmanager/Contoso.WidgetManager/tspconfig.yaml#L35)\\r\\n  - Allowed values: strings that matches the regex `/^\\\\@azure-rest\\\\/[a-z]+(?:-[a-z]+)*$/`\\r\\n  - example: `@azure-rest/aaa-bbb`\\n\\n\\u003e Please follow the below steps to configure.

It allows users to create issues in the forum to ask questions, report bugs and provide feedback.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost issues can be classified into 3 categories. They are\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Usage error.\\r\\n2. Feature request.\\r\\n3. Bug report.\\n\\n## Usage error (For users)\\n\\nIf you are not familiar with the SDK usage of a service, you can find relevant examples in [this repo][sample repo] in most cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some common errors, you can check [here](#summary-of-common-errors).\\n\\n## Feature Request (For users)\\n\\nPython SDKs are automatically generated based on REST API, so we generally do not recommend modifying SDK code manually. If you need a new function, but the SDK does not provide it, you need to open an issue in the [REST API repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues) to describe clearly the feature you want.\\n\\n## Bug Report (For users)\\n\\nPlease describe the bug in as much detail as possible, such as listing the SDK package name, version and operating system info you use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can provide detailed reproduction steps, it will help us locate and solve the issue.\\n\\n## Summary Of Common Errors\\n\\n### Error from Track1 to Track2\\n\\nIf the code you use needs to set wait() function for the Long Running Operation to wait for the result, it should be the SDK of Track1. We have stopped maintenance at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe strongly recommend that you update the SDK version. Then you will find that in the SDK of Track2, we all use the function name prefixed with `begin_` for LRO operations, and the result() method can be used to get the returned result.\\r\\n(More Details: [guidance][guidance])\\n\\n### Possible Error from Service\\n\\nSince the python SDK is generated based on the [rest API][rest API], it will not deliberately change the returned results. So if you think the returned result is not as expected, please open the issue under the [rest issue][rest issue].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003chr/\\u003e\\n\\n## Resolve issue (For contributors)\\n\\nBug report is one of the most common issues reported in open-source community. Basic steps to resolve a bug report are\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Confirm the bug.\\r\\n2. Locate the fault.\\r\\n3. Fix the bug.\\n\\n### Confirm the Bug\\n\\nConfirm whether it is a bug. If you can definitely identify it is a bug according description of the issue, then go to next step. Otherwise, try to reproduce the bug by yourself. You can ask the issue reporter for details such as version, concrete steps and logs so that you can understand the issue better and it is more likely to be able to reproduce the bug. It is not rare that it is not a bug. Instead, it is a usage error. Refer to \\\"Usage Error\\\" section.\\n\\n### Locate the Fault\\n\\nFault localization is critical to bug fix. Some tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Analyzing logs. It helps you understand the bug.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Step-by-step debugging. Most modern IDEs provide integrated debugging experience.\\n\\n### Fix the bug\\n\\nOnce you have confirmed the bug and found the fault location, it should be easy to fix the bug. Add a sample if it is missing. Remember to tell users when the fix will released.\\n\\n## Common Principles\\n\\nIf the issue is not from the SDK but from the [rest API][rest API], you can reply to the user and reopen the issue in the appropriate place.\\n\\n### Error like (AttributeError: 'PipelineResponse' object has no attribute 'get')\\n\\nWhen this error occurs, you can check the version of `msrest` and upgrade it to latest version then try again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[sample repo]: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-samples-python-management\\r\\n[rest API]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs\\r\\n[rest issue]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues\\r\\n[SDK dependency]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/shared_requirements.txt\\r\\n[guidance]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/migrating-python-management-libraries/\"},{\"document_source\":\"azure-sdk-docs-eng\",\"document_filename\":\"support#support.md\",\"document_title\":\"\",\"document_link\":\"https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/support/support\",\"content\":\"# support#support.md\\n\\n| Short Link: | [aka.ms/azsdk/support](https://aka.ms/azsdk/support) |\\r\\n| --- | --- |\\n\\n# Get help and support\\n\\n\\u003c!-- A short description of this page (fewer than 50 words) that describes the main learning goal or task that readers\\r\\nwill complete. --\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have problems or questions when using Azure SDK tools or releasing your updates, you can get help by following\\r\\nguidance provided in this article.\\n\\n## Get help with PRs submitted against the Azure REST API specification repositories\\n\\nIf you submitted a pull request against the specs repositories by following the  \\r\\n[Create or update an Azure REST API spec](xref:api-specs-pr) article,\\r\\nfirst check the description and comments on the pull request to troubleshoot any issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, check [relevant section in our FAQ](xref:faq#azure-rest-api-specs-prs).\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, if you need more help, see the [Get more help](#get-more-help) section.\\n\\n## Get help with the Azure SDKs development\\n\\nIf you need help with the development or testing of the SDK refer to the language-specific teams channels:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [.NET Teams channel]\\r\\n- [C Teams channel]\\r\\n- [C++ Teams channel]\\r\\n- [Java Teams channel]\\r\\n- [Go Teams channel]\\r\\n- [Mobile Teams Channel]\\r\\n- [Python Teams channel]\\r\\n- [Rust Teams channel]\\r\\n- [TypeScript/JS Teams channel]\\n\\n## Get help with the Azure SDKs Engineering system (language repositories)\\n\\nIf you need help with the engineering system supporting the `azure-sdk-for-*` language repositories,\\r\\nlike e.g. [azure-sdk-for-python], refer to [the EngSys support page](xref:support-engsys).\\n\\n## Provide feedback on this documentation\\n\\nPlease use the **Is this page helpful?** buttons.

The sdk failures for flattenProperty are due to those SDKs not being up-to-date with the latest version of typespec-client-generator-core, which was released earlier this week.

This issue typically arises from one of the following:\\\\n\\\\n1. The TypeSpec C# emitter (@azure-tools/typespec-csharp) or its dependencies are out of date and do not match the expected helper accessibility.\\\\n2. Your tspconfig.yaml does not have the required configuration for management plane generation, resulting in incompatible or missing code stubs.\\\\n3. There is a known issue in the C# generator that needs to be resolved by updating the generator package or adjusting your configuration.\\\\n\\\\n**How to resolve:**\\\\n\\\\n- **Update your dependencies:**\\\\n  Ensure that your `package.json` contains the latest version of `@azure-tools/typespec-csharp`. Run `tsp install` to refresh dependencies.\\\\n  \\\\n- **Check tspconfig.yaml configuration:**\\\\n  For a management plane SDK, your tspconfig.yaml should include the following emitter options:\\\\n\\\\n  ```yaml\\\\n  emit:\\\\n    - \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-csharp\\\\\\\"\\\\n  options:\\\\n    \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-csharp\\\\\\\":\\\\n      flavor: azure\\\\n      package-dir: \\\\\\\"Azure.ResourceManager.Genome\\\\\\\"\\\\n      clear-output-folder: true\\\\n      model-namespace: true\\\\n      namespace: \\\\\\\"{package-dir}\\\\\\\"\\\\n  ```\\\\n\\\\n  Reference the [Contoso.Management sample tspconfig.yaml](https://aka.ms/azsdk/tspconfig-sample-mpg) for exact option usage.\\\\n\\\\n- **Re-run code generation:**\\\\n  After updating your config and dependencies, run:\\\\n  ```bash\\\\n  tsp compile path/to/main.tsp\\\\n  ```\\\\n  and ensure the generated code does not reference inaccessible helpers.\\\\n\\\\n- **If the issue persists:**\\\\n  This may be a regression or a bug in the generator. Reach out to the .NET Teams channel for help:\\\\n  [.NET Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7b87fb348f224b37b6206fa9d89a105b%40thread.skype/Language%2520-%2520DotNet?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)\\\\n  Provide your PR link and details of the error.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Update your TypeSpec C# emitter to the latest version.\\\\n- Ensure tspconfig.yaml matches the management plane sample configuration.\\\\n- Re-run code generation and build.\\\\n- If unresolved, contact the .NET Teams channel with your PR and error details.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach is aligned with the Azure SDK engineering and TypeSpec guidance for .NET SDK validation issues.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"This has been fixed in azure-sdk-for-net, and will be synced to azure-sdk-for-net-pr during the day.

            "inputs.response": "You are following the correct process for removing retired API specs, and encountering a Swagger LintDiff failure is expected when deleting specs. According to Azure REST API specs guidelines, when retiring or deleting preview API versions, the PR should fail the Swagger BreakingChange check but pass all other required checks. LintDiff failures do not need to be resolved when deleting API specs.\n\nHere is how to proceed:\n- You do NOT need to resolve the Swagger LintDiff failure for a PR that removes retired specs.\n- The official process is:\n  1. Open a PR deleting the TypeSpec sources (*.tsp), related examples, generated swaggers, and remove tags from readme.md.\n  2. The PR should fail Swagger BreakingChange but pass other checks.\n  3. Request approval for the breaking change by contacting the breaking change review board (https://aka.ms/brch or azbreakchangereview@microsoft.com).\n\nIf your PR is blocked from merging due to the LintDiff failure, request an explicit approval from the breaking change review board. In practice, once approval is given, a maintainer may override or force-merge the PR despite the LintDiff failure.\n\nReferences below confirm that LintDiff failures can be ignored for spec deletions and breaking changes in this context. You do not need to suppress or fix LintDiff for deletions. Simply follow the breaking change approval process and proceed once approved.",

This is particularly interesting\\r\\nfor common infrastructure changes that are committed in the repo (i.e. github actions, tools, etc). Depending on how old your\\r\\nbranch is some of the pull request checks may not correctly function without taking a merge from main. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are working in a non-protected branch you can do a `git merge main` like you would normally do a merge and then push\\r\\nyour changes to your remote branch. However, if you are working in a branch with branch protection enabled (i.e. `release-*`) then\\r\\nyou will need to make a pull request to your branch with the merge. Depending on how out-of-date your branch is from `main` your \\r\\nmerge may have a lot of unwanted and unnecessary changes and the checks not pass. In such cases see below on how to [update the infrastructure](#updating-only-the-infrastructure-changes-from-main).\\n\\n### Updating only the infrastructure changes from main\\n\\nIn cases you need to only update the infrastructure code and not the specifications we have a helper pipeline \\r\\nwhich you can run that will create a pull request with a selective merge. The selective merge will include everything except for specs \\r\\nunder the specifications folder. This will enable you to only update the infrastructure and not other specs which should get your checks \\r\\npassing in your protected branch. Follow these steps to run the helper pipeline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e This should only be needed for protected branches, such as `release-*`. If you are in an unprotected branch, just use a normal `git merge main`.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Go to [tools - update-release-branch-in-specs](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7487) and select **Run Pipeline**.\\r\\nIf you don't have permission see [GitHub account linked with your Microsoft account](xref:access).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Enter the name of your branch in the **BranchToMergeTo** parameter. Usually this will be in the form `release-\\u003cname\\u003e`.  You shouldn't need to set \\r\\nthe other parameters but if your branch is in the private repo then you will need to update **Repo** to be `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr`.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Click the **Run** button.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The pipeline should only take a few minutes to run and once it is complete then go find the pull request it created. You can find a link to it in the \\r\\npipeline logs under the **Create Pull Request to merge** step. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Monitor the created pull request and approve it. Once the checks are green then merge the pull request and then your branch should be updated with the latest infrastructure changes.\\r\\nIf you have open PRs against your branch with failing checks, go to those PRs and retrigger the checks. The easiest way to retrigger all checks\\r\\nis to hit the close button followed by the open button, which should cause the checks to re-run.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\n1.

Validation`.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor simplicity, we recommend adding all suppressions to a single file at the root of your spec folder:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nspecification/myservice/suppressions.yaml\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, you can use multiple files in separate folders.  Currently, tools will use the first\\r\\ninstance of `suppressions.yaml` found walking up the directory tree.  We are planning\\r\\nfuture support for \\\"merging\\\" files up the hierarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA suppression follows this general format:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n- tool: ToolName\\r\\n  path: applies/to/**/*.json\\r\\n  reason: Why this can't be fixed\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n`path` uses \\\"glob\\\" matching.  For syntax, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch.\\r\\n\\r\\nScope your `path` as narrowly as possible.  For example, if a suppression only applies\\r\\nto a single version of your spec:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n# good\\r\\n- path: data-plane/Azure.Contoso.WidgetManager/preview/2022-11-01-preview/**/*.json\\r\\n\\r\\n# bad\\r\\n- path: data-plane/**/*.json\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in doubt, search the repo for examples:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAzure%2Fazure-rest-api-specs+path%3A%2F%28%5E%7C%5C%2F%29suppressions%5C.yaml%24%2F\\u0026type=code\\n\\n### `TypeSpec Requirement` check\\n\\nTo suppress `TypeSpec Requirement` check for given pattern of OpenAPI spec .json file paths, provide an entry with\\r\\n`tool` set to `TypeSpecRequirement`. Provide the pattern as `path` and provide a `reason`.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n- tool: TypeSpecRequirement\\r\\n  path: data-plane/**/*.json\\r\\n  reason: Brownfield service not ready to migrate\\r\\n```\\n\\n## Suppress AutoRest extension\\n\\nTo suppress tooling that is an AutoRest extension (see [the suppressio\"},{\"document_source\":\"azure_resource_manager_rpc\",\"document_filename\":\"v1.0#patch-resource.md\",\"document_title\":\"Patch Resource #\",\"document_link\":\"https://github.com/cloud-and-ai-microsoft/resource-provider-contract/blob/master/v1.0/patch-resource.md\",\"content\":\"# v1.0#patch-resource.md\\n\\n# Patch Resource #\\n\\n## Overview ##\\n\\nA `Patch` operation updates a resource and it is strongly recommended that service teams implement it. ARM requires RPs to support `Patch` for updating tags for a **tracked** resource.\\n\\n### Request ###\\n\\n| Method | Request URI |\\r\\n| --- | --- |\\r\\n| Patch | `https://\\u003cendpoint\\u003e/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}?api-version={api-version}` |\\r\\n\\r\\n**Arguments**\\r\\n\\r\\n[Common Arguments](./uri-format-and-arguments-for-crud-apis-on-resources.md)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Request Body**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe request body of a `Patch` operation **must** contain atleast one property. The properties specified **must** be present in the resource definition as defined in the response of the corresponding `Get` or the request body of a `Put` operation. For the explanation of these properties please see the PUT Resource section. Of note, just like for a `Put` operation, a user can \\\\*not\\\\* update the location, type or name of their resource with a `Patch` operation. These properties are either immutable or readOnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behavior for patching of the fields inside the properties envelope should follow JSON merge-patch ([RFC 7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396)).\\n\\n### Response ###\\n\\nThe response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a response body. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Status Code**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resource provider **must** return 200 (OK) to indicate that the synchronous `Patch` operation completed successfully. 202 (Accepted) **must** be returned to indicate that the operation will complete [asynchronously](async-api-reference.md#asynchronous-operations).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the resource group \\\\*or\\\\* resource does not exist, 404 (NotFound) should be returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Response Headers**\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaders common to all responses.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Response Body**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe response body **must** contain the updated resource using the existing values for all other properties and the updated value(s) for properties provided in the request body of the `Patch` operation. The response body of a `Patch` operation **must** be the same as the response body of the corresponding `Put` or `Get` operation of the same resource type.\\n\\n### Common scenarios for implementing Patch ###\\n\\n**Tags**\\r\\n\\r\\nA common scenario for the usage of a `Patch` operation is to update the `tags` section of a **tracked** resource. The behavior for a `Patch` operation of the tags property is to replace the tags property with the  keys and values provided with the `Patch` operation. Eg: if the resource currently has tag1 and tag2, and a `Patch` request sends tag3, the final resource should have tag3 (and \\\\*not\\\\* tag1, tag2 and tag3).\\r\\n\\r\\n**SKU** \\r\\nIf a respource provider exposes the notion of SKUs for their resource types, the `Patch` operation may be supported for the SKU property to support scaling. For example, the following operation should update the SKU of the resource to be Free and not affect any of the other properties of the resource:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Request Body**\\r\\n\\r\\n```json\\r\\n{\\r\\n  \\\"sku\\\": {\\r\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"F0\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"capacity\\\": 1\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n## Rules ##\\n\\n### General impact of violating the rules ###\\n\\n|\\r\\n| RPC-Patch-V1-11 | Resource providers may implement `Patch` for the Identity property if the service allows it to be updated. | Required | No additional impact. | Design |  [Click to view documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/docs/patch-identity-property.md) |\\r\\n| RPC-Patch-V1-12 | Every `Patch ` request **must** have a request body. | Required | No additional impact. | Design |  [Click to view documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/docs/request-body-must-exist-for-put-patch.md) |\\n\\nProviding support for `Patch` for as many properties as possible helps avoid accidental and unintentional updates to other properties that need not be touched.

The interesting thing is, the place I'm violating the rules, its swagger is the same as before. Why these violations are not reported before?\\n\\n## answer\\n\\nThe LintDiff errors in your PR are not necessarily new violations. Many of them already existed in the main branch, but previously, CI failures weren’t blocking, so these issues were effectively allowed to persist unnoticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, because your PR is part of a TypeSpec (TSP) migration, the generated Swagger includes many differences—over 3,000 diffs in total—due to normalization by the AutoRest emitter. These changes are functionally equivalent but not textually identical, which makes it hard for the LintDiff auto-baselining algorithm to recognize unchanged areas. As a result, you’re seeing errors flagged as new, even if the same issues existed in main.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the unreliability of the auto-baselining mechanism, we recommend not depending on it. Instead, all LintDiff errors—regardless of whether they are newly introduced or pre-existing—should be explicitly suppressed in the `readme.md` file.

The interesting thing is, the place I'm violating the rules, its swagger is the same as before. Why these violations are not reported before?\\n\\n## answer\\n\\nThe LintDiff errors in your PR are not necessarily new violations. Many of them already existed in the main branch, but previously, CI failures weren’t blocking, so these issues were effectively allowed to persist unnoticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, because your PR is part of a TypeSpec (TSP) migration, the generated Swagger includes many differences—over 3,000 diffs in total—due to normalization by the AutoRest emitter. These changes are functionally equivalent but not textually identical, which makes it hard for the LintDiff auto-baselining algorithm to recognize unchanged areas. As a result, you’re seeing errors flagged as new, even if the same issues existed in main.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the unreliability of the auto-baselining mechanism, we recommend not depending on it. Instead, all LintDiff errors—regardless of whether they are newly introduced or pre-existing—should be explicitly suppressed in the `readme.md` file.

Specifically, patterns like {width}x{height} or {x}/{y}@{scale}x in your API paths are now breaking validation due to stricter parsing rules introduced in path-to-regexp@6.2.1.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, your spec passed validation because older versions of path-to-regexp were more lenient. The recent update introduced security fixes that inadvertently caused this break.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo unblock your PR, we’ve deployed a temporary fix that pins path-to-regexp to an older version. This means your Swagger checks should no longer crash. Meanwhile, we’re working on a permanent solution that doesn’t rely on pinning old code.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you still need to validate locally, you can manually install the older version and run oav like this:\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\u003cinstall node 20\\u003e\\r\\nmkdir testdirectory\\r\\ncd testdirectory\\r\\nnpm i oav path-to-regexp@6.2.2\\r\\nnpx oav validate-example /path/to/your/openapi.json\\r\\n```\\r\\nAlternatively, you can use validate-spec instead of validate-example if you're checking the spec directly. This workaround has been confirmed to pass for your PR.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve also applied the approved-modelvalidation and approved-semanticvalidation labels to your PR to unblock progress.

Efforts these past few months have been made to migrate users to PostgreSql Flexible Server.\nWe wish to remove the operations associated with single server found here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/postgresql/Azure.ResourceManager.PostgreSql/src/PostgreSql\nWant to confirm what is the exact process to remove the operations:\nIs official request needed?\nDo we manually remove the files associated to the resource?\nThank you for the help.",
            "inputs.ground_truth": "You will need to update the libraries for all 5 languages, not just .NET, to support the deprecation / retirement and migration.\nFor .NET, does the library currently contain operations for both the single server and flexible server?  If so, the REST API version(s) in question would need to be retired first, and then new SDK libraries would need to be generated.\nFor some of the other languages (like Python, Go, and Java), were there separate libraries for single server and flexible server?\nI'm looping in our Shanghai team for assistance - Josephine, Arthur, and Renhe.\nOnce we work out how the libraries map to the different service versions, the instructions on how to deprecate an entire library for each language are here: [Deprecating Azure SDKs](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/retirement/sdk-deprecation)",
            "inputs.response": "To remove the management-plane operations for PostgreSql Single Server from the Azure SDK for .NET, you must follow the official Azure API and SDK retirement/deprecation process. Manual removal of files from the SDK repository is not sufficient and should only occur after all required steps are completed.\n\nHere’s the process you need to follow:\n\n1. **Service/API Retirement Approval and Coordination**:\n   - Confirm that the API version and service are fully retired per Azure’s retirement policy. You must have gone through the official breaking change approval and customer communication process, especially since Single Server is a GA service. See [CPEX Breaking Change Process](https://aka.ms/CPEXBreakingChangesProcess).\n   - Coordinate with ARM/API owners and ensure that the corresponding REST API spec is removed from the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repository once the service/API version is fully retired.\n\n2. **SDK Deprecation and Dashboard Update**:\n   - Mark the relevant .NET SDK package as deprecated in the Azure SDK inventory dashboard. This requires editing the `dotnet-packages.csv` file in the Azure SDK repo and setting the `Support` field to `deprecated`, the `EOLDate` to the end-of-support date, and providing a `Replace` and `ReplaceGuide` (e.g., pointing to Flexible Server and a migration guide).\n   - Submit a PR for this change; this triggers the update on the public [Azure SDK dashboard](https://aka.ms/azsdk) and will notify the repo owners for review.\n\n3. **Package Manager Updates and Deprecation Notices**:\n   - Ensure NuGet is updated with a deprecation message, replacement package info, and migration guide. This is automated after the CSV change is merged, but you may need to manually request popularity transfer for search ranking (see instructions for emailing NuGet).\n   - Update README files in the repo and package manager pages with deprecation notices and migration guidance.\n\n4. **Code Removal**:\n   - After all deprecation steps and notifications are complete and the API spec is removed, you may then submit a PR to remove the actual source files for Single Server operations from the SDK repository.\n   - The PR should clearly reference the official retirement and deprecation approvals, and include breaking change details in the release notes and CHANGELOG.\n   - The removal is a breaking change and must be tracked as such in the release notes and communicated to customers (typically a 3-year notification period is required for GA breaking changes unless otherwise approved).\n\n5. **Release Pipeline**:\n   - Once the removal PR is approved and merged, run the SDK release pipeline and verify the release package, documentation, and notes reflect the change. Ensure all steps in the release plan are marked complete.\n\n**Do not manually remove files before the above steps are completed.** All removal actions must be traceable to the official deprecation/retirement process to avoid accidental breaking changes and ensure compliance with Azure customer communication policies.\n\nIf you have questions or need support, reach out to the [Azure SDK Onboarding channel](https://aka.ms/azsdk/support/onboarding-channel).\n",

This is a manual step and requires sending an email to account@nuget.org with the names of deprecated packages whose popularity should be transferred, and the list of stable packages that should receive the popularity transfer for each deprecated package. If deprecating more than ten packages, list them in tabular form using two columns: new ID, old ID.

It applies if your spec PR has\\r\\n`BreakingChangeReviewRequired` or `VersioningReviewRequired` label.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!IMPORTANT]\\r\\n\\u003e This is an advanced deep-dive. If your PR is blocked on breaking changes or versioning issues, you should always\\r\\n\\u003e start by following the guidance at [aka.ms/brch].\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nThis article assumes you are familiar with [API versions and branches](xref:api-versions-and-branches).\\n\\n### Video overview and slides\\n\\nFor video overview of the breaking changes process, see this [Azure Core Day of Learning talk from March 6, 2024].\\r\\nSlides for the talk are available [here][talk slides].\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nPer the [PR diagram], the first step of getting your specs PR approved is ensuring your PR obeys the  \\r\\n[Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy]. Relevant details of this policy follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Once published, no changes to given API version are allowed, except when fixing the spec to match\\r\\nactual implementation (see the `-Approved-BugFix` labels in this doc).\\r\\nThis applies regardless of whether the API version is for `private preview`, `public preview`, or `GA`.\\r\\n- When introducing a new API version (any `preview` or `GA`), the new API version must be backwards compatible with\\r\\nthe previous, latest `GA` API version.\\r\\n- During a (`private` or `public`) `preview` cycle, a new `preview` API version does not have to be backwards\\r\\ncompatible with the previous `preview` API version.\\r\\n- The rules listed above are checked by automated GitHub checks. The exact ruleset is given in [`oadMessagesRuleMap.ts`].\\r\\nDetails follow.\\n\\n## Breaking changes and versioning issues\\n\\nThere are two automatic checks running on your PR checking for conformance\\r\\nto the [Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy]:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `Breaking Change(Cross-Version)` that ensures you don't introduce breaking changes or violate versioning policy\\r\\n*across* two API versions.\\r\\n- `Swagger BreakingChange` that ensures you didn't introduce breaking changes or violated versioning policy\\r\\n*within* any single API version.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of running these checks may result in one of these labels being applied: `BreakingChangeReviewRequired`\\r\\nor `VersioningReviewRequired`. If this happens, your PR is **blocked** from any further review, including ARM review,\\r\\nif applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breaking change/versioning checks are performed only on PRs targeting the `main` branch in the [public specs repo]\\r\\nor `RPSaaSMaster` branch of the [private specs repo].\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two branches are `production branches`. Merging an API specification to either of them publishes it\\r\\nfor all customers to use \\u0026 consume.\\n\\n### `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` label\\n\\nThe label `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` is added to your PR if the tooling detects a change that could\\r\\nbe breaking for customers. This can happen in two cases:\\r\\n\\r\\n- In your PR you have possibly introduced a breaking change in a new API version, placed in a new folder,\\r\\nas compared to most recent previous `GA`.\\r\\nThe new API version can be either `preview` or `GA`.\\r\\n  - For example, an existing `GA` API version in leaf folder of `2023-11-15`\\r\\nmay contain API route of `GET .../resoruces/{resourceName}`, but a new `preview` API version of `2024-03-15-preview`\\r\\nmay no longer have this route (REST API path), because you are removing the `resoruces` typo and instead introducing\\r\\n`GET .../resources/{resourceName}` route.\\r\\n- In your PR you are modifying existing `GA` API version in-place. For example, you have recently released\\r\\n`2024-03-18` API version and realized you made a typo and are editing the contents of the leaf folder `2024-03-18`\\r\\ncontaining that API version.\\n\\n### `VersioningReviewRequired` label\\n\\nThe label `VersioningReviewRequired` denotes that your PR has a **versioning issue** possibly violating the  \\r\\n[Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy]. This happens when you made a **non-breaking change**,\\r\\naka **compatible change** to an API version that was already published (merged to a production branch).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e According to [the policy][Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy], compatible (non-breaking changes) are not\\r\\n\\u003e allowed within an existing API version. You must create a new API version. Otherwise, we would confuse our customers\\r\\n\\u003e by having to explain \\\"which version of given API version\\\" has a particular change/feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n`VersioningReviewRequired` label is added by automation if:\\r\\n\\r\\n- You made any compatible changes **within** any API version, `GA` or `preview`.\\r\\n- You made any breaking changes in a `preview` API version.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your PR has both breaking changes and versioning issues, only `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` label\\r\\nis added to it.\\n\\n### In case there is no latest GA API version\\n\\nIf there is no latest GA OpenAPI spec, then the the cross-version check is instead comparing to\\r\\nlatest available preview if it more than 1 year old.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf neither a GA API version or at least 1 year old preview version exists, then the cross-version check automatically\\r\\npasses.\\n\\n### Diagram explaining breaking changes and versioning issues\\n\\nThe logic for automation adding `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` and `VersioningReviewRequired` labels explained above\\r\\ncan be summarized in the following diagram:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Breaking Changes Confusion Matrix](../../img/breaking_changes_confusion_matrix.png)\\n\\n## Addressing `BreakingChangeReviewRequired`\\n\\nIf your PR is labelled with `BreakingChangeReviewRequired`, per Step 1 from the [PR diagram],\\r\\nyou must follow the process given at [aka.ms/brch].\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Breaking Change Review Board determines the breaking changes in your PR are acceptable, they will be\\r\\napproved by one of these labels:\\n\\n### `BreakingChange-Approved-Benign`\\n\\nThe changes to the REST API definition are not breaking at the REST API level and have at most minor impact to\\r\\ngenerated SDKs, so the change is allowed.\\n\\n### `BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix`\\n\\nThe changes to the REST API definition are correcting the definition to accurately describe the service behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!TIP]\\r\\n\\u003e As a PR author, you are allowed to apply the `BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix` label.

Efforts these past few months have been made to migrate users to PostgreSql Flexible Server.\\\\nWe wish to remove the operations associated with single server found here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/postgresql/Azure.ResourceManager.PostgreSql/src/PostgreSql\\\\nWant to confirm what is the exact process to remove the operations:\\\\nIs official request needed?\\\\nDo we manually remove the files associated to the resource?\\\\nThank you for the help.\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"To remove the management-plane operations for PostgreSql Single Server from the Azure SDK for .NET, you must follow the official Azure API and SDK retirement/deprecation process. Manual removal of files from the SDK repository is not sufficient and should only occur after all required steps are completed.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s the process you need to follow:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Service/API Retirement Approval and Coordination**:\\\\n   - Confirm that the API version and service are fully retired per Azure\\\\u2019s retirement policy. You must have gone through the official breaking change approval and customer communication process, especially since Single Server is a GA service. See [CPEX Breaking Change Process](https://aka.ms/CPEXBreakingChangesProcess).\\\\n   - Coordinate with ARM/API owners and ensure that the corresponding REST API spec is removed from the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repository once the service/API version is fully retired.\\\\n\\\\n2. **SDK Deprecation and Dashboard Update**:\\\\n   - Mark the relevant .NET SDK package as deprecated in the Azure SDK inventory dashboard. This requires editing the `dotnet-packages.csv` file in the Azure SDK repo and setting the `Support` field to `deprecated`, the `EOLDate` to the end-of-support date, and providing a `Replace` and `ReplaceGuide` (e.g., pointing to Flexible Server and a migration guide).\\\\n   - Submit a PR for this change; this triggers the update on the public [Azure SDK dashboard](https://aka.ms/azsdk) and will notify the repo owners for review.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Package Manager Updates and Deprecation Notices**:\\\\n   - Ensure NuGet is updated with a deprecation message, replacement package info, and migration guide. This is automated after the CSV change is merged, but you may need to manually request popularity transfer for search ranking (see instructions for emailing NuGet).\\\\n   - Update README files in the repo and package manager pages with deprecation notices and migration guidance.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Code Removal**:\\\\n   - After all deprecation steps and notifications are complete and the API spec is removed, you may then submit a PR to remove the actual source files for Single Server operations from the SDK repository.\\\\n   - The PR should clearly reference the official retirement and deprecation approvals, and include breaking change details in the release notes and CHANGELOG.\\\\n   - The removal is a breaking change and must be tracked as such in the release notes and communicated to customers (typically a 3-year notification period is required for GA breaking changes unless otherwise approved).\\\\n\\\\n5. **Release Pipeline**:\\\\n   - Once the removal PR is approved and merged, run the SDK release pipeline and verify the release package, documentation, and notes reflect the change. Ensure all steps in the release plan are marked complete.\\\\n\\\\n**Do not manually remove files before the above steps are completed.** All removal actions must be traceable to the official deprecation/retirement process to avoid accidental breaking changes and ensure compliance with Azure customer communication policies.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have questions or need support, reach out to the [Azure SDK Onboarding channel](https://aka.ms/azsdk/support/onboarding-channel).\\\\n\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You will need to update the libraries for all 5 languages, not just .NET, to support the deprecation / retirement and migration.\\\\nFor .NET, does the library currently contain operations for both the single server and flexible server?  If so, the REST API version(s) in question would need to be retired first, and then new SDK libraries would need to be generated.\\\\nFor some of the other languages (like Python, Go, and Java), were there separate libraries for single server and flexible server?\\\\nI'm looping in our Shanghai team for assistance - Josephine, Arthur, and Renhe.\\\\nOnce we work out how the libraries map to the different service versions, the instructions on how to deprecate an entire library for each language are here: [Deprecating Azure SDKs](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/retirement/sdk-deprecation)\\\"}\"}]",

            "inputs.response": "Here is the confirmed deprecation workflow for retiring the HDInsightOnAks Preview API and its SDKs based on the provided Azure SDK onboarding documentation:\n\n1. **API Spec Removal:**\n   - For preview REST APIs, follow the Azure REST API wiki deprecation process (see https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Deprecating-Preview-APIs). Once the API version is fully retired, you should remove the corresponding API spec folder from the `azure-rest-api-specs` repo. Ensure you follow the process for preview API deprecation, which may include communication and documentation steps.\n\n2. **SDK Deprecation Communication:**\n   - Sending an email alone is **not sufficient** for formal SDK deprecation. The required steps are:\n     - Update the SDK package status in the Azure SDK inventory dashboard and public package managers.\n     - For official process and guidance, refer to [Azure SDK deprecation guidelines](https://aka.ms/azsdk/deprecation).\n     - There is no mandated email template in the knowledge, but communications should include the EOL date, replacement package (if any), and migration guide (if available). The recommended message format for package managers is:\n       - \"This package has been deprecated and will no longer be maintained after <EOLDate>. Upgrade to the replacement package, <Replace>, to continue receiving updates. Refer to the migration guide (<ReplaceGuide>) for guidance on upgrading. Refer to our deprecation policy for more details.\"\n\n3. **Update SDK Dashboard and Package Managers:**\n   - You must update the language-specific CSV files in the Azure SDK repo (`_data/releases/latest/{language}-packages.csv`) for each deprecated SDK package. Set `Support` to `deprecated`, add the `EOLDate`, and fill out `Replace`/`ReplaceGuide` fields as appropriate. See full step-by-step instructions in the knowledge context.\n   - After updating the CSV and merging the PR, automation will update the Azure SDK dashboard and, for .NET, also update NuGet.\n   - For other package managers (PyPI, NPM, Maven, pkg.go.dev), follow the linked language-specific deprecation process to update the package metadata and add a deprecation notice.\n\n4. **SDK Source Code Removal:**\n   - After deprecation, Track 1 library code can be moved out of the repository (deleted or archived), but release tags will still provide access. The service team is generally responsible for initiating code removal. You should update the README and package manager with a deprecation notice first. \n   - For zero-usage, preview SDKs, you may mark them deprecated at any time and remove/archive the code once deprecation is communicated.\n   - If you need help with code removal, reach out to the relevant language release driver (contact info in the knowledge).\n\n5. **Deprecation Annotation:**\n   - The final deprecation outcome is to have the package metadata (dashboard and package manager) reflect the deprecated status. There is **no requirement** to add a Deprecated annotation in code, but it is best practice to add deprecation notices in the README and in package manager metadata.\n\n**Missing Steps/Requirements:**\n- Make sure to unpublish any REST API reference documentation before removing the spec from GitHub (reach out to the Learn API Reference Docs team and/or fill out the provided template).\n- For preview APIs, follow the preview deprecation process as outlined in the Azure REST API specs wiki.\n- If a GA version existed, a 12-month notification period is required for deprecation, but preview versions can be deprecated immediately if unused.\n\n**Summary Action Items:**\n- Remove API spec folder (after following preview API deprecation steps).\n- Unpublish REST API reference docs.\n- Update SDK dashboard and package managers via CSV edits and language-specific processes.\n- Communicate deprecation (update README, package metadata, optional email notification).\n- Remove/archive SDK source code after dashboard/package manager updates.\n\nIf you need further help or have questions about specific language repos, reach out to the Azure SDK Onboarding channel or the listed release drivers.",

This is a manual step and requires sending an email to account@nuget.org with the names of deprecated packages whose popularity should be transferred, and the list of stable packages that should receive the popularity transfer for each deprecated package. If deprecating more than ten packages, list them in tabular form using two columns: new ID, old ID.

Remove the HDInsightOnAks spec folder from azure-rest-api-specs\\\\n2. After removing the HDInsightOnAks API, send SDK deprecation email to Josephine\\\\na) For SDK deprecation, do we only need to send an email? Is there a recommended email template?\\\\nb) For each language repo, should I manually remove the code, or will the SDK team handle the removal?\\\\nc) Is the final deprecation outcome to add a Deprecated annotation?\\\\nPlease confirm and add any missing steps. Thanks!\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"Here is the confirmed deprecation workflow for retiring the HDInsightOnAks Preview API and its SDKs based on the provided Azure SDK onboarding documentation:\\\\n\\\\n1. **API Spec Removal:**\\\\n   - For preview REST APIs, follow the Azure REST API wiki deprecation process (see https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Deprecating-Preview-APIs). Once the API version is fully retired, you should remove the corresponding API spec folder from the `azure-rest-api-specs` repo. Ensure you follow the process for preview API deprecation, which may include communication and documentation steps.\\\\n\\\\n2. **SDK Deprecation Communication:**\\\\n   - Sending an email alone is **not sufficient** for formal SDK deprecation. The required steps are:\\\\n     - Update the SDK package status in the Azure SDK inventory dashboard and public package managers.\\\\n     - For official process and guidance, refer to [Azure SDK deprecation guidelines](https://aka.ms/azsdk/deprecation).\\\\n     - There is no mandated email template in the knowledge, but communications should include the EOL date, replacement package (if any), and migration guide (if available). The recommended message format for package managers is:\\\\n       - \\\\\\\"This package has been deprecated and will no longer be maintained after <EOLDate>. Upgrade to the replacement package, <Replace>, to continue receiving updates. Refer to the migration guide (<ReplaceGuide>) for guidance on upgrading. Refer to our deprecation policy for more details.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n3. **Update SDK Dashboard and Package Managers:**\\\\n   - You must update the language-specific CSV files in the Azure SDK repo (`_data/releases/latest/{language}-packages.csv`) for each deprecated SDK package. Set `Support` to `deprecated`, add the `EOLDate`, and fill out `Replace`/`ReplaceGuide` fields as appropriate. See full step-by-step instructions in the knowledge context.\\\\n   - After updating the CSV and merging the PR, automation will update the Azure SDK dashboard and, for .NET, also update NuGet.\\\\n   - For other package managers (PyPI, NPM, Maven, pkg.go.dev), follow the linked language-specific deprecation process to update the package metadata and add a deprecation notice.\\\\n\\\\n4. **SDK Source Code Removal:**\\\\n   - After deprecation, Track 1 library code can be moved out of the repository (deleted or archived), but release tags will still provide access. The service team is generally responsible for initiating code removal. You should update the README and package manager with a deprecation notice first. \\\\n   - For zero-usage, preview SDKs, you may mark them deprecated at any time and remove/archive the code once deprecation is communicated.\\\\n   - If you need help with code removal, reach out to the relevant language release driver (contact info in the knowledge).\\\\n\\\\n5. **Deprecation Annotation:**\\\\n   - The final deprecation outcome is to have the package metadata (dashboard and package manager) reflect the deprecated status. There is **no requirement** to add a Deprecated annotation in code, but it is best practice to add deprecation notices in the README and in package manager metadata.\\\\n\\\\n**Missing Steps/Requirements:**\\\\n- Make sure to unpublish any REST API reference documentation before removing the spec from GitHub (reach out to the Learn API Reference Docs team and/or fill out the provided template).\\\\n- For preview APIs, follow the preview deprecation process as outlined in the Azure REST API specs wiki.\\\\n- If a GA version existed, a 12-month notification period is required for deprecation, but preview versions can be deprecated immediately if unused.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary Action Items:**\\\\n- Remove API spec folder (after following preview API deprecation steps).\\\\n- Unpublish REST API reference docs.\\\\n- Update SDK dashboard and package managers via CSV edits and language-specific processes.\\\\n- Communicate deprecation (update README, package metadata, optional email notification).\\\\n- Remove/archive SDK source code after dashboard/package manager updates.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need further help or have questions about specific language repos, reach out to the Azure SDK Onboarding channel or the listed release drivers.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"Before you remove the specs folder, you need to make sure that any REST API docs on Learn are moved first:  Retiring Azure APIs.\\\\nDetails on how to mark each SDK library as deprecated are here:  Deprecating Azure SDKs.

Is this done by the SDK team?\n[azure-rest-api-specs/specification/cdn/resource-manager/Microsoft.Cdn/Cdn/preview/2024-07-22-previe…](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/cdn/resource-manager/Microsoft.Cdn/Cdn/preview/2024-07-22-preview/edgeaction.json)",

            "inputs.response": "The official Azure REST API reference documentation on Microsoft Learn (https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/) is published automatically for new resource providers (RPs) once their OpenAPI specs are merged into the `main` branch of the public Azure REST API specs repository (`azure-rest-api-specs`).\n\nThe process is not handled by the SDK team directly, but rather by the Azure Content Publishing Services team and automated pipelines:\n\n1. **Merge Your Spec**: You must ensure your OpenAPI (or TypeSpec-generated OpenAPI) files and the necessary README configuration are merged into `main` in the `azure-rest-api-specs` repo.\n\n2. **Onboarding**: For first-time onboarding of a new RP, you need to submit an onboarding request to the Content Publishing Services team. This enables your RP's specs to be picked up for documentation generation. See [Onboard reference content on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/help/onboard/reference?branch=main).\n\n3. **Automatic Refresh**: After initial onboarding, API references are automatically refreshed weekly (typically on Tuesdays) if the README is correctly configured and merged. Any changes merged to the repo will be picked up and published without manual intervention.\n\n4. **Publishing Pipeline**: When a PR is opened, the `spec - api-doc-preview` pipeline runs, onboarding the updated specs into a preview repo, and triggers a pipeline in the Learn organization to generate preview documentation. The results are reported back to your PR.\n\n**Summary**: Publishing the official documentation is managed by the Content Publishing Services team and automated Azure pipelines, not by the SDK team. Your responsibility is to ensure the spec and configuration files are correctly merged and to onboard with the publishing team for first-time RP documentation.\n\nFor more details and support, you can:\n- Review the [official publishing guide](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-docs)\n- Ask questions in the [API Reference and Samples Teams Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/dl/launcher/launcher.html?url=%2F_%23%2Fl%2Fchannel%2F19%3A7506cc3e220f430ab89d992c7db5284f%40thread.skype%2FAPI%2520Reference%2520and%2520Samples%3FgroupId%3Dde9ddba4-2574-4830-87ed-41668c07a1ca%26tenantId%3D72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).\n\n**Note:** If your RP is already onboarded and uses the automatic refresh, no further action is needed for subsequent updates—just merge your changes to `main` and they will be picked up.",

This is particularly interesting\\r\\nfor common infrastructure changes that are committed in the repo (i.e. github actions, tools, etc). Depending on how old your\\r\\nbranch is some of the pull request checks may not correctly function without taking a merge from main. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are working in a non-protected branch you can do a `git merge main` like you would normally do a merge and then push\\r\\nyour changes to your remote branch. However, if you are working in a branch with branch protection enabled (i.e. `release-*`) then\\r\\nyou will need to make a pull request to your branch with the merge. Depending on how out-of-date your branch is from `main` your \\r\\nmerge may have a lot of unwanted and unnecessary changes and the checks not pass. In such cases see below on how to [update the infrastructure](#updating-only-the-infrastructure-changes-from-main).\\n\\n### Updating only the infrastructure changes from main\\n\\nIn cases you need to only update the infrastructure code and not the specifications we have a helper pipeline \\r\\nwhich you can run that will create a pull request with a selective merge. The selective merge will include everything except for specs \\r\\nunder the specifications folder. This will enable you to only update the infrastructure and not other specs which should get your checks \\r\\npassing in your protected branch. Follow these steps to run the helper pipeline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e This should only be needed for protected branches, such as `release-*`. If you are in an unprotected branch, just use a normal `git merge main`.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Go to [tools - update-release-branch-in-specs](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7487) and select **Run Pipeline**.\\r\\nIf you don't have permission see [GitHub account linked with your Microsoft account](xref:access).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Enter the name of your branch in the **BranchToMergeTo** parameter. Usually this will be in the form `release-\\u003cname\\u003e`.  You shouldn't need to set \\r\\nthe other parameters but if your branch is in the private repo then you will need to update **Repo** to be `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr`.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Click the **Run** button.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The pipeline should only take a few minutes to run and once it is complete then go find the pull request it created. You can find a link to it in the \\r\\npipeline logs under the **Create Pull Request to merge** step. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Monitor the created pull request and approve it. Once the checks are green then merge the pull request and then your branch should be updated with the latest infrastructure changes.\\r\\nIf you have open PRs against your branch with failing checks, go to those PRs and retrigger the checks.

This enables your RP's specs to be picked up for documentation generation. See [Onboard reference content on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/help/onboard/reference?branch=main).\\\\n\\\\n3. **Automatic Refresh**: After initial onboarding, API references are automatically refreshed weekly (typically on Tuesdays) if the README is correctly configured and merged. Any changes merged to the repo will be picked up and published without manual intervention.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Publishing Pipeline**: When a PR is opened, the `spec - api-doc-preview` pipeline runs, onboarding the updated specs into a preview repo, and triggers a pipeline in the Learn organization to generate preview documentation. The results are reported back to your PR.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary**: Publishing the official documentation is managed by the Content Publishing Services team and automated Azure pipelines, not by the SDK team.

            "inputs.response": "Based on the Azure API versioning and breaking change policies, if your PR is blocked due to breaking changes errors, there are specific steps you must follow to resolve this.\n\n1. **Diagnose the Cause**: Breaking changes errors in PR pipelines usually mean your changes either introduce a breaking change to a published API version or violate versioning rules (e.g., modifying a published version, even for non-breaking changes).\n   - Use the guidance at [aka.ms/brch](https://aka.ms/brch) for a step-by-step process.\n   - If your PR is labeled with `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` or `VersioningReviewRequired`, you must resolve these before further review or merging can proceed.\n\n2. **Pipeline Bust Diagnosis**: If the breaking changes team says the pipeline is \"bust,\" it's important to verify if this is due to a tooling failure or a genuine spec issue:\n   - Run the validation locally using the documented process (see references below). This will help determine if the error is reproducible outside the CI system:\n     ```\n     git clean -xdf\n     git pull\n     npm ci\n     npx tsv specification/your-service-folder\n     ```\n   - If the problem persists locally, it's a real spec issue. If not, there may be a CI configuration or sync problem.\n\n3. **Resolving Breaking Changes**:\n   - If your change is a real breaking change and you believe it is benign, a bugfix, or already approved, you (or the review board) can apply the appropriate approval label as documented (see references).\n   - If your change is not intended to be breaking, review your TypeSpec changes and ensure you are not modifying any published API contracts. For any required changes, always introduce a new API version instead of modifying an existing one.\n\n4. **Branch Sync Issues**: If the error is due to branch sync (e.g., target branch out of sync with `main`), follow the documented process to update your branch with changes from main:\n     - [Update your branch with changes from main](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-tutorial/api-tutorial-3-publish#update-your-branch-with-changes-from-main)\n\n5. **Further Help**:\n   - If local validation matches the pipeline error, and you believe it is a false positive or a tooling bug, document the steps and reach out on the [TypeSpec Discussion teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A906c1efbbec54dc8949ac736633e6bdf%40thread.skype/TypeSpec%20Discussion?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).\n   - If you are blocked by a spec repo sync issue, the spec owner is responsible for keeping branches synchronized (main <-> RPSaaSMaster, etc.).\n\n**Summary:**\n- Run validation locally to confirm whether the error is real or a CI pipeline issue.\n- Do not modify published API versions directly; create new versions for changes.\n- Apply the appropriate approval label if your breaking change is a bugfix or previously approved.\n- If the issue is a pipeline tooling failure, contact the spec repo owner or TypeSpec Discussion teams channel.\n\nLet me know if you need help with specific error logs or validation output!",

Generate SDK code from a TypeSpec project\\n\\n### 1. Introduction\\n\\nThis document describes the processes of developing Azure REST APIs and SDKs with TypeSpec language. The steps below\\r\\n assumes that you are developing TypeSpec API specifications in the `azure-rest-api-specs` and `azure-rest-api-specs-pr`repos.\\r\\nIf you are developing within your own ADO repo first and then submitting into `azure-rest-api-specs` repos for review and\\r\\n release, you will need to copy the TypeSpec files over.\\n\\n### 2. Repo setup \\u0026 prerequisites\\n\\n- The main repos for Azure REST APIs are [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs) and [azure-rest-api-specs-pr](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr)\\r\\n repos. The `-pr` repo contains `RPSaaSMaster` and `RPSaaSDev` branches for ProviderHub based ARM service specs.\\r\\n#### 2.1 With local machine development\\r\\n- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18 or above (LTS Recommended).\\r\\n Ensure you can run the npm command in a command prompt:\\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n    npm --version\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- Run following command in the **repository root folder**. This will install required packages such as TypeSpec\\r\\n compilers and Azure Library packages.\\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n     npm ci\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- Ensure you can run TypeSpec command within the repo folders.\\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n     npx tsp --version\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- One-time set up: Install TypeSpec VisualStudio or VS Code extensions to get syntex highlighting, tool tips in IDE:  \\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n    npx tsp code install\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  OR\\r\\n    ```npm\\r\\n      npx tsp vs install\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n#### 2.2  VS Code with local docker .devcontainer\\r\\nAll prerequisites have been installed in the dev container. You should to have `Docker Desktop` and `WSL2` running if\\r\\n you are on Windows machine.\\r\\nTo start, you just need to install `Dev Containers` VS code extension, then open the repo path.\\r\\n- VS Code will detect the .devcontainer and prompt you to reopen the workspace.\\r\\n- Alternatively, you can use Command Palette -\\u003e Dev Containers: Reopen in Container.  \\r\\nOnce VS Code reopened in Container, you can run any of the program below in the VS Code integrated terminal.\\r\\n#### 2.2 VS Code in browser via GitHub codespaces\\r\\nGitHub codespaces leverage the same dev container in the repo. The difference is it is hosted in cloud with VS Code in\\r\\n browser.\\r\\nTo start, you just need to browse to the `azure-rest-api-specs` repo, select `\\u003c\\u003e Code` drop down and follow `Codespaces`\\r\\n instructions.\\n\\n### 3. Creating a new TypeSpec project\\n\\nPlease first review recommended folder structure detailed in [this document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/directory-structure.md).\\r\\n1. Under `[reporoot]\\\\specification`, create service folder directly.\\r\\n   - Select `(rest-api-spec repo) ARM` or `(rest-api-spec repo) Data-plane` and answer appropriate naming questions.\\r\\n   - If it's ARM service, the service folder would be `specification/{organization}/resource-manager/\\u003cRPNS\\u003e/{service}`.\\r\\n   - If it's Data Plane service, the service folder would be `specification/{organization}/data-plane/{service}`\\r\\n2. Create a new TypeSpec project based on Azure template with command:\\r\\n    ```cli\\r\\n       npx tsp init https://aka.ms/typespec/azure-init\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n3. Compile the generated TypeSpec project with command:\\r\\n    ```cli\\r\\n      npx tsp compile .\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n    The generated OpenAPI files should be correctly placed in the `{service}`folders following the naming conventions.\\r\\n4. Now the project has been set up. You can modify the sample and develop your own APIs with TypeSpec.\\n\\n### 4. Prepare and submit a Pull Request for reviewing\\n\\n1. Create a branch in your local repository for your changes.\\r\\n2. Create or update the TypeSpec files for your service.\\r\\n3. Add or update 'examples' files for each operation of your OpenAPI file.\\r\\n   The [oav](https://github.com/Azure/oav) provides two ways to generate OpenAPI examples:\\r\\n   1. Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\r\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set. Since the auto-generated\\r\\n     examples consist of random values for most types, you need replace them with meaningful values.\\r\\n       ```bash\\r\\n       oav generate-examples openapi.json\\r\\n       ```\\r\\n    Note, latest OAV tool should automatically generate the following. However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\r\\n     please ensure you have:\\r\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\r\\n    - include `operationId`. This is used to match with declared operations in TypeSpec and correctly output in OpenAPI.\\r\\n4. Add/update the `readme.md` file in the `{service}` folder to specify the version and location of the OpenAPI files. The `readme.md` is needed for both management-plane and data-plane services for REST API Docs generation.\\r\\n   Example:[sample-readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/widget/resource-manager/Microsoft.Widget/Widget/readme.md)\\r\\n5. Generate OpenAPI files:\\r\\n   - sync with the target branch in the azure-rest-api-specs repo\\r\\n      ```git\\r\\n       git pull upstream \\u003ctarget-branch\\u003e\\r\\n      ```\\r\\n   - in the root directory, run `npm install`\\r\\n   - in the project directory, `npx tsp compile`. This will generate OpenAPI files under `{service}` folders.\\r\\n6. Ensure all generated files under `{service}` have been added to PR.\\r\\n7. Send a pull request .\\r\\n   - commit all your changes.\\r\\n   - push your branch to your fork of the repo.\\n\\n5. Generate OpenAPI files:\\r\\n   - sync with the target branch in the azure-rest-api-specs repo\\r\\n      ```git\\r\\n       git pull upstream \\u003ctarget-branch\\u003e\\r\\n      ```\\r\\n   - in the root directory, run `npm install`\\r\\n   - in the project directory, `npx tsp compile`. This will generate OpenAPI files under `{service}` folders.\\r\\n6. Ensure all generated files under `{service}` have been added to PR.\\r\\n7. Send a pull request .\\r\\n   - commit all your changes.\\r\\n   - push your branch to your fork of the repo.\\r\\n   - send a pull request to the original repo from your forked repo.\\r\\n   See the ARM Wiki for information on the [supported repos and branches for management-plane services](https://armwiki.azurewebsites.net/rpaas/swaggeronboarding.html#supported-github-reposbranches).\\r\\n#### 4.1 Fix the errors of PR reviewing CI checks\\r\\nThe CI checks result will be commented on the PR. you can refer to the [CI fix Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/ci-fix.md).\\r\\nNote:\\r\\nSince the OpenAPI is generated from TypeSpec, to change the OpenAPI, you must update the TypeSpec file and regenerate the\\r\\n OpenAPI and avoid updating OpenAPI directly to keep the consistency between OpenAPI and TypeSpec.\\r\\nFor support \\u0026 help, you can post a message to [TypeSpec Discussion - teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A906c1efbbec54dc8949ac736633e6bdf%40thread.skype/TypeSpec%20Discussion?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121\\u0026tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).\\n\\n### 5.

It applies if your spec PR has\\r\\n`BreakingChangeReviewRequired` or `VersioningReviewRequired` label.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!IMPORTANT]\\r\\n\\u003e This is an advanced deep-dive. If your PR is blocked on breaking changes or versioning issues, you should always\\r\\n\\u003e start by following the guidance at [aka.ms/brch].\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nThis article assumes you are familiar with [API versions and branches](xref:api-versions-and-branches).\\n\\n### Video overview and slides\\n\\nFor video overview of the breaking changes process, see this [Azure Core Day of Learning talk from March 6, 2024].\\r\\nSlides for the talk are available [here][talk slides].\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nPer the [PR diagram], the first step of getting your specs PR approved is ensuring your PR obeys the  \\r\\n[Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy]. Relevant details of this policy follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Once published, no changes to given API version are allowed, except when fixing the spec to match\\r\\nactual implementation (see the `-Approved-BugFix` labels in this doc).\\r\\nThis applies regardless of whether the API version is for `private preview`, `public preview`, or `GA`.\\r\\n- When introducing a new API version (any `preview` or `GA`), the new API version must be backwards compatible with\\r\\nthe previous, latest `GA` API version.\\r\\n- During a (`private` or `public`) `preview` cycle, a new `preview` API version does not have to be backwards\\r\\ncompatible with the previous `preview` API version.\\r\\n- The rules listed above are checked by automated GitHub checks. The exact ruleset is given in [`oadMessagesRuleMap.ts`].\\r\\nDetails follow.\\n\\n## Breaking changes and versioning issues\\n\\nThere are two automatic checks running on your PR checking for conformance\\r\\nto the [Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy]:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `Breaking Change(Cross-Version)` that ensures you don't introduce breaking changes or violate versioning policy\\r\\n*across* two API versions.\\r\\n- `Swagger BreakingChange` that ensures you didn't introduce breaking changes or violated versioning policy\\r\\n*within* any single API version.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of running these checks may result in one of these labels being applied: `BreakingChangeReviewRequired`\\r\\nor `VersioningReviewRequired`. If this happens, your PR is **blocked** from any further review, including ARM review,\\r\\nif applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breaking change/versioning checks are performed only on PRs targeting the `main` branch in the [public specs repo]\\r\\nor `RPSaaSMaster` branch of the [private specs repo].\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two branches are `production branches`. Merging an API specification to either of them publishes it\\r\\nfor all customers to use \\u0026 consume.\\n\\n### `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` label\\n\\nThe label `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` is added to your PR if the tooling detects a change that could\\r\\nbe breaking for customers. This can happen in two cases:\\r\\n\\r\\n- In your PR you have possibly introduced a breaking change in a new API version, placed in a new folder,\\r\\nas compared to most recent previous `GA`.\\r\\nThe new API version can be either `preview` or `GA`.\\r\\n  - For example, an existing `GA` API version in leaf folder of `2023-11-15`\\r\\nmay contain API route of `GET .../resoruces/{resourceName}`, but a new `preview` API version of `2024-03-15-preview`\\r\\nmay no longer have this route (REST API path), because you are removing the `resoruces` typo and instead introducing\\r\\n`GET .../resources/{resourceName}` route.\\r\\n- In your PR you are modifying existing `GA` API version in-place. For example, you have recently released\\r\\n`2024-03-18` API version and realized you made a typo and are editing the contents of the leaf folder `2024-03-18`\\r\\ncontaining that API version.\\n\\n### `VersioningReviewRequired` label\\n\\nThe label `VersioningReviewRequired` denotes that your PR has a **versioning issue** possibly violating the  \\r\\n[Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy]. This happens when you made a **non-breaking change**,\\r\\naka **compatible change** to an API version that was already published (merged to a production branch).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e According to [the policy][Azure Versioning and Breaking Changes Policy], compatible (non-breaking changes) are not\\r\\n\\u003e allowed within an existing API version. You must create a new API version. Otherwise, we would confuse our customers\\r\\n\\u003e by having to explain \\\"which version of given API version\\\" has a particular change/feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n`VersioningReviewRequired` label is added by automation if:\\r\\n\\r\\n- You made any compatible changes **within** any API version, `GA` or `preview`.\\r\\n- You made any breaking changes in a `preview` API version.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your PR has both breaking changes and versioning issues, only `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` label\\r\\nis added to it.\\n\\n### In case there is no latest GA API version\\n\\nIf there is no latest GA OpenAPI spec, then the the cross-version check is instead comparing to\\r\\nlatest available preview if it more than 1 year old.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf neither a GA API version or at least 1 year old preview version exists, then the cross-version check automatically\\r\\npasses.\\n\\n### Diagram explaining breaking changes and versioning issues\\n\\nThe logic for automation adding `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` and `VersioningReviewRequired` labels explained above\\r\\ncan be summarized in the following diagram:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Breaking Changes Confusion Matrix](../../img/breaking_changes_confusion_matrix.png)\\n\\n## Addressing `BreakingChangeReviewRequired`\\n\\nIf your PR is labelled with `BreakingChangeReviewRequired`, per Step 1 from the [PR diagram],\\r\\nyou must follow the process given at [aka.ms/brch].\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Breaking Change Review Board determines the breaking changes in your PR are acceptable, they will be\\r\\napproved by one of these labels:\\n\\n### `BreakingChange-Approved-Benign`\\n\\nThe changes to the REST API definition are not breaking at the REST API level and have at most minor impact to\\r\\ngenerated SDKs, so the change is allowed.\\n\\n### `BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix`\\n\\nThe changes to the REST API definition are correcting the definition to accurately describe the service behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!TIP]\\r\\n\\u003e As a PR author, you are allowed to apply the `BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix` label.

Can you please help on this.\\\\nPR: Enabling free services acquisition via APIs by adrianta \\\\u00b7 Pull Request #25230 \\\\u00b7 Azure/azure-rest-ap\\\\u2026\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"Based on the Azure API versioning and breaking change policies, if your PR is blocked due to breaking changes errors, there are specific steps you must follow to resolve this.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Diagnose the Cause**: Breaking changes errors in PR pipelines usually mean your changes either introduce a breaking change to a published API version or violate versioning rules (e.g., modifying a published version, even for non-breaking changes).\\\\n   - Use the guidance at [aka.ms/brch](https://aka.ms/brch) for a step-by-step process.\\\\n   - If your PR is labeled with `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` or `VersioningReviewRequired`, you must resolve these before further review or merging can proceed.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Pipeline Bust Diagnosis**: If the breaking changes team says the pipeline is \\\\\\\"bust,\\\\\\\" it's important to verify if this is due to a tooling failure or a genuine spec issue:\\\\n   - Run the validation locally using the documented process (see references below). This will help determine if the error is reproducible outside the CI system:\\\\n     ```\\\\n     git clean -xdf\\\\n     git pull\\\\n     npm ci\\\\n     npx tsv specification/your-service-folder\\\\n     ```\\\\n   - If the problem persists locally, it's a real spec issue. If not, there may be a CI configuration or sync problem.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Resolving Breaking Changes**:\\\\n   - If your change is a real breaking change and you believe it is benign, a bugfix, or already approved, you (or the review board) can apply the appropriate approval label as documented (see references).\\\\n   - If your change is not intended to be breaking, review your TypeSpec changes and ensure you are not modifying any published API contracts. For any required changes, always introduce a new API version instead of modifying an existing one.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Branch Sync Issues**: If the error is due to branch sync (e.g., target branch out of sync with `main`), follow the documented process to update your branch with changes from main:\\\\n     - [Update your branch with changes from main](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-tutorial/api-tutorial-3-publish#update-your-branch-with-changes-from-main)\\\\n\\\\n5. **Further Help**:\\\\n   - If local validation matches the pipeline error, and you believe it is a false positive or a tooling bug, document the steps and reach out on the [TypeSpec Discussion teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A906c1efbbec54dc8949ac736633e6bdf%40thread.skype/TypeSpec%20Discussion?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).\\\\n   - If you are blocked by a spec repo sync issue, the spec owner is responsible for keeping branches synchronized (main <-> RPSaaSMaster, etc.).\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Run validation locally to confirm whether the error is real or a CI pipeline issue.\\\\n- Do not modify published API versions directly; create new versions for changes.\\\\n- Apply the appropriate approval label if your breaking change is a bugfix or previously approved.\\\\n- If the issue is a pipeline tooling failure, contact the spec repo owner or TypeSpec Discussion teams channel.\\\\n\\\\nLet me know if you need help with specific error logs or validation output!\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You are confusing two checks:\\\\nBreaking Changes(Cross-Version) - Analyze Code\\\\nimplementation detail\\\\nnot required\\\\nBreaking Changes(Cross-Version)\\\\nrequired\\\\npassing due to label\\\\nI suspect your PR cannot be merged, because your github account is missing one or more required permissions. https://aka.ms/azsdk/access\\\\nThis must be public, not private: https://github.com/orgs/Azure/people?query=adrianta\\\\nOnce your permissions are fixed, push a change to your PR (empty commit is fine) to rerun checks.\\\"}\"}]",

            "inputs.response": "Based on the provided knowledge, Azure SDK folder structure and naming conventions should be consistent and logical, but there is no explicit requirement to align Data Plane (DP) SDKs under the same folder as Control Plane (CP) SDKs. The current structure, with CP SDKs under 'playwright' and DP SDKs under 'loadtesting' or 'loadtestservice', is acceptable as long as it clearly reflects the functionality and purpose of each SDK. \n\nIf you decide to align the folder structure (e.g., move DP SDKs under 'playwright'), you must ensure the following:\n- Update all relevant metadata and documentation (including CSV files for release metadata, README files, and reference docs) to reflect the new locations.\n- Follow Azure SDK naming conventions for package names, folders, and namespaces (see [Azure SDK Architecture design guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html)).\n- Coordinate deprecation and migration guidance for any affected packages using the official SDK deprecation guidelines (update EOLDate, Support, Replace, and ReplaceGuide fields in the CSV, and README/package manager notices).\n- Submit PRs for the folder moves in each affected repo, and update CODEOWNERS and service labels as needed to ensure correct reviewer assignment and issue routing.\n- Verify the changes do not break automated build, test, or documentation generation pipelines (refer to [Publish SDK reference docs] and [Test your SDK]).\n- Communicate any migration steps to customers, especially if package names or import paths change.\n\nGiven the context of MPT retirement and Azure App Testing merger, clear migration and deprecation communication is essential. Unless there is a specific cross-repo policy or automation dependency requiring alignment, it is acceptable to keep DP and CP SDKs in separate, clearly named folders reflecting their functionality.\n\nIf you proceed with the move, the recommended process is:\n1. Plan the new folder structure and naming, ensuring alignment with Azure SDK conventions.\n2. Update metadata files, README, and package managers to reflect new locations and migration guides.\n3. Move the source code and test assets to the new folder in a dedicated PR for each language repo.\n4. Update CODEOWNERS, service labels, and review assignments for the new folder.\n5. Verify build, test, and docs generation pipelines work post-move.\n6. Communicate changes and migration instructions to customers, including deprecation of old package paths if needed.\n7.

Changes to the docs repo that are not mirrored to the source SDK repo will be overwritten by content from the source\\r\\n\\u003e SDK repo on the next package release.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Find the Package-level overview using the table from [Package-level overviews](#package-level-overviews).\\r\\n2. Find the corresponding README.md file for the library in the SDK repo (e.g. [azure-sdk-for-net](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net)).\\r\\n3. Update the \\\"front matter\\\" date field at the beginning of the file to today's date. To update other front matter metadata, see [Ensure CSV metadata is correct](#ensure-csv-metadata-is-correct).\\r\\n4. Copy changed content from step 2 into the Package-level overview from step 1.\\r\\n5. Open a pull request for the update file in the docs repo\\n\\nIf your package is released through the Azure SDK engineering system, almost everything is automated. You'll need to\\r\\ntake action if this is your first time releasing a package.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen releasing a package for the first time:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package is tracked in the  \\r\\n[release work items](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/Release/_queries/query/7d106acd-a1c2-47b9-9676-996422328397/). This can be done by running the [**Prepare-Release.ps1** script](https://aka.ms/azsdk/mark-release-status).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each item for your release, you should have a value for **Service Name** and **Package Display Name**. The docs table of contents is generated from this data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e Do not skip this step. If you skip the service name, your item will appear in the TOC in the **Other** \\u003e **Uncategorized** section.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure that your package-level overview file (the README.md file for your package in the SDK source repo) is up to date\\r\\n*before* releasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the automated system will ensure that updated docs are onboarded within a day or two of your release.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo customize information about your package outside of the engineering system consult documentation for [CSV fields](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\r\\nand [Service Level Overview](#service-level-overview) and [Package Level Overview](#package-level-overview).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Troubleshooting automated documentation updates\\r\\n\\r\\nAn automation job runs every 2 hours during business hours on weekdays. If your data is\\r\\nnot updated and you don't want to wait, [run the job manually](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=1284).\\r\\nThis will update the metadata PR.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find anything unexpected in the table of contents or service README, check the\\r\\n[metadata CSV file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/tree/main/_data/releases/latest) to ensure that the metadata is\\r\\ncorrect. If the metadata is not correct, open a PR with corrections.\\n\\n### Packages released outside the Azure SDK engineering system\\n\\n- **ServiceDirectory** -- Name of the service (e.g. `storage`).\\r\\n- **DirectoryPath** -- Path from the root of the `azure-sdk-for-*` repo to the package. If unknown or the package is not released from an `azure-sdk-for-*` repo, use the value `\\\"\\\"`\\r\\n- **SdkType** -- Use values `client` or `mgmt` to place the package in the appropriate location in the table of contents.\\r\\n- **IsNewSdk** -- Use `true` if the package is a track 2 SDK, otherwise use `false`.\\r\\n- **Group** -- Required *only for Java*\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace the metadata JSON file in the `metadata/\\u003cmoniker\\u003e` folder with the name of the package. For example, the metadata\\r\\nJSON file for the `Azure.Storage.Blobs` package would be named\\r\\n[`Azure.Storage.Blobs.json`](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/metadata/latest/Azure.Storage.Blobs.json).\\r\\nFor Java packages, name the file for the artifact and omit the group ID (e.g.\\r\\n[`azure-storage-blob.json`](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-java/blob/main/metadata/latest/azure-storage-blob.json)).\\r\\n\\r\\n|  | .NET | Java | JS | Python |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| Metadata Location | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/metadata) | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-java/tree/main/metadata) | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-node/tree/main/metadata) | [Link](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/tree/main/metadata) |\\n\\nFor more information on CSV fields, see: [metadata CSV readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/eng/README.md#csv-fields)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca id=\\\"service-level-overview\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Service-level overviews \\r\\n\\r\\nService-level overviews provide a list of relevant packages. Service-level overview pages are generated automatically\\r\\nfor each service and contain a list of packages.\\r\\n\\r\\nService teams can create their own service-level overview pages which contain more information. Service teams that\\r\\ncreate their own service-level overview pages are responsible for updating those pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create a service-level overview page, look for the relevant markdown for your service. Service-level markdown files\\r\\nare named in the format `service-name.md` where spaces are replaced with dashes (`-`). For example the service-level\\r\\noverview for the `Key Vault` service would be named `key-vault.md`.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn `[!INCLUDE]` directive can be used to include a list of packages which will be automatically updated as metadata\\r\\nabout new packages is available.\\r\\n\\r\\n```md\\r\\n[!INCLUDE [packages](advisor-index.md)]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of packages is in a file whose name is of the form `\\u003cservice\\u003e-index.md`.\\r\\n\\r\\nService-level overview examples:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Custom service-level overview requiring manual edits: [Python Storage](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/blob/main/docs-ref-services/latest/storage.md)\\r\\n- Service-level overview generated automatically: [Python Advisor](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-sdk-python/blob/main/docs-ref-services/latest/advisor.md)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003ca id=\\\"package-level-overview\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Package-level overviews\\r\\n\\r\\nPackage level overviews are generated from the README.md file in the package source as part of the\\r\\nrelease process.

The current structure, with CP SDKs under 'playwright' and DP SDKs under 'loadtesting' or 'loadtestservice', is acceptable as long as it clearly reflects the functionality and purpose of each SDK. \\\\n\\\\nIf you decide to align the folder structure (e.g., move DP SDKs under 'playwright'), you must ensure the following:\\\\n- Update all relevant metadata and documentation (including CSV files for release metadata, README files, and reference docs) to reflect the new locations.\\\\n- Follow Azure SDK naming conventions for package names, folders, and namespaces (see [Azure SDK Architecture design guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html)).\\\\n- Coordinate deprecation and migration guidance for any affected packages using the official SDK deprecation guidelines (update EOLDate, Support, Replace, and ReplaceGuide fields in the CSV, and README/package manager notices).\\\\n- Submit PRs for the folder moves in each affected repo, and update CODEOWNERS and service labels as needed to ensure correct reviewer assignment and issue routing.\\\\n- Verify the changes do not break automated build, test, or documentation generation pipelines (refer to [Publish SDK reference docs] and [Test your SDK]).\\\\n- Communicate any migration steps to customers, especially if package names or import paths change.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the context of MPT retirement and Azure App Testing merger, clear migration and deprecation communication is essential. Unless there is a specific cross-repo policy or automation dependency requiring alignment, it is acceptable to keep DP and CP SDKs in separate, clearly named folders reflecting their functionality.\\\\n\\\\nIf you proceed with the move, the recommended process is:\\\\n1. Plan the new folder structure and naming, ensuring alignment with Azure SDK conventions.\\\\n2. Update metadata files, README, and package managers to reflect new locations and migration guides.\\\\n3. Move the source code and test assets to the new folder in a dedicated PR for each language repo.\\\\n4. Update CODEOWNERS, service labels, and review assignments for the new folder.\\\\n5.

The error message 'Cannot find module prettier/plugins/estree' typically indicates that your local Prettier installation is missing required dependencies, or that the Prettier version installed does not match the expected one by the repo (especially with custom plugins like 'prettier-swagger-plugin.js').\n\nTo resolve this:\n\n1. Ensure you are using the correct Prettier version and that all dependencies are installed:\n   - Run `git clean -xdf` in the root of your repo to remove all node_modules and build artifacts (note: this deletes all untracked files).\n   - Run `npm ci` to install the exact versions specified in package-lock.json. This will ensure all required Prettier plugins (including any custom ones for Swagger) are installed.\n\n2. After installation, re-run your prettier command:\n   - `npx prettier --write specification/maps/data-plane/Weather/stable/1.1/weather.json`\n\n3. If you still see errors, check that your repo is up to date:\n   - Run `git pull` to ensure you have the latest scripts and configuration.\n\nIf problems persist, try cloning your repo into a new directory and repeat the steps above, as sometimes local environment issues can interfere.\n\nThis advice is consistent with the troubleshooting steps documented in the Azure REST API specs wiki for local validation and formatting. Prettier and its plugins must match what the CI expects, and a fresh npm install after cleaning out node_modules is the best way to ensure that.\n\nFor more details, refer to the 'Running Locally' section in the TypeSpec Validation wiki, which addresses similar issues for formatting and validation scripts.",

They are intuitive, naturally reflecting and communicating the\\r\\nunderlying model and its behavior. They lend themselves easily to client library implementations in multiple\\r\\nprogramming languages. And they don't \\\"get in the way\\\" of the developer, by remaining stable and predictable,\\r\\nespecially over time.\\n\\n## Start with hero scenarios\\n\\nStart the design process by identifying a small number of the most important *jobs to be done* by customers and how\\r\\nthese will be accomplished with the service. These are often called the *hero scenarios*.\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing on hero scenarios reduces development, support, and maintenance costs, enables teams to align and reach\\r\\nconsensus faster, and accelerates the time to delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, a hero scenario for Azure Blob Storage could be:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e Upload the contents of a file to a new Azure Blob in an existing Blob Storage container.\\n\\n## Define terms and concepts\\n\\nAfter you identify the hero scenarios that you want to address, list the terms that describe any new abstractions\\r\\nand relationships that you're introducing in your API design.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e You'll need to show and describe any new concepts or terms during [REST API review](xref:api-review).\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Define the terms and core concepts of your new service or feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure to define simple, understandable abstractions with clear names that you use consistently throughout your API\\r\\nand documentation. Keep in mind that the words that you use in your REST API design impact the content experience\\r\\nfor all other downstream customer-facing assets, such as SDK, CLI, product documentation, and Azure Portal\\r\\nexperiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nTip: Work with your PM and content developer to review new concepts or terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Keep a glossary of terms and definitions that describe the relationships between your resources.\\n\\n## Follow the Azure API guidelines and conventions\\n\\nAzure has established guidelines and conventions for REST API structure and style.

For more information on TypeSpec Azure, visit [here](https://aka.ms/typespec/azure).\\r\\n\\r\\n[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) is the new standard API definition language for Azure, developed by Microsoft. It is an open-source tool designed to generate OpenAPI specifications and other API description languages. TypeSpec can also produce client code, with service code generation in progress. TypeSpec offers highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST patterns used for Azure.\\n\\n## Benefits of TypeSpec\\n\\n- **Consistency across APIs**: TypeSpec ensures consistency across APIs by using high-level templates, reducing the need for repetitive tasks and minimizing errors. This uniform design approach acts as a single source of truth for API definitions, enhancing both consistency and quality.\\r\\n- **Efficiency and speed**: TypeSpec significantly reduces the amount of code needed to define API specifications. A ten-line code snippet in TypeSpec can generate a hundred lines of an OpenAPI specification, drastically reducing manual effort.\\r\\n- **Enhanced tooling**: TypeSpec comes with advanced tools that catch errors early, leading to more robust APIs. Additionally, extensions for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespecvs) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespec-vscode) aid in efficient TypeSpec creation.\\r\\n- **Accessibility**: The compact nature of TypeSpec, combined with its familiar JavaScript-style syntax, allows even non-technical stakeholders to participate in the API review and design process.\\n\\n## Case Studies\\n\\nHear directly from teams who have successfully transitioned to TypeSpec Azure and learn about their experiences:\\n\\n### Azure Batch\\n\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EUkgwSc69lpPsBjQBfLfMEgB0WCTBe9x7ozU8VNK2s8mAw?e=1MIXZi)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"There's definitions in Swagger, but … TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\"\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice. The VS code integration right out of the box is something I've really liked.\\\"\\n\\n### MS Learn\\n\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EXjQ3t7i-z9BpxVUgZVcS6QBxjLYdRLUquX2y8xczNxfbA?e=nesl3Q)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e “One of the highlights [of using TypeSpec] was our ability to author API specs in a very simple and intuitive language. This meant that even [our PMs] who are not engineers were able to understand these API specifications. They could review them, make comments, and participate in designing those APIs.”\\n\\n### Azure AI Content Safety\\n\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EdlE2PYtZ9BKoXQ-R0h-O10B9RidePBT4mwB1JgIqRC01A?e=JRneI2)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"I find TypeSpec to be much simpler to learn and write compared to Swagger. In my experience, Swagger often encounters many conflicts due to its JSON format. TypeSpec proves to be a much better alternative as it allows everyone to work independently on their own sections, making it more user-friendly. Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\"\\n\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\n\\nWhether you're working with Data Plane (DP) or Azure Resource Manager (ARM), having clear examples to follow can make your transition to TypeSpec smoother. Here are some resources that can help:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Playground Examples**: Our playground provides ARM and DP examples that serve as excellent models for teams new to TypeSpec Azure. These examples are concise and take full advantage of our standard operation templates. You can use these as a gold standard for your own TypeSpec definitions.

All requests to resource providers may include the following standard headers and **must** be supported:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Header | Description |\\r\\n| --- | --- |\\r\\n| Content-Type | Set to application/json. This header is not sent in requests that don\\u0026#39;t have any content, such as all GET calls. |\\r\\n| Accept-Language | Specifies the preferred language for the response; all RPs should use this header when generating error messages or client facing text. |\\r\\n| x-ms-client-request-id | Caller-specified value identifying the request, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces (e.g. `client-request-id: 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0`). If the caller provides this header – the resource provider **must** log this with their traces to facilitate tracing a single request. If specified, this will be included in response information as a way to map the request if \\\"x-ms-return-client-request-id\\\"; is specified as \\\"true\\\". Because this header can be client-generated, it should not be assumed to be unique by the RP implementation. |\\r\\n| x-ms-correlation-request-id | Optional. Caller-specified value identifying a set of related operations that the request belongs to, in the form of a GUID. If the caller does not specify this header, ARM will randomly generate a unique GUID. Used for tracing the correlation Id of the request; the resource provider **must** log this so that end-to-end requests can be correlated across Azure. Because this header can be client-generated or re-used for multiple requests, it should not be assumed to be unique by the RP implementation. |\\r\\n| x-ms-return-client-request-id | Optional. True or false and indicates if a client-request-id should be included in the response. Default is false. |\\n\\n## Request Query Parameters ##\\n\\nARM will proxy request parameters (e.g. $filter; $expand; $skipToken; etc.) as-is to the Resource Providers. It will not delete, modify or add any query parameters before relaying the request. The only exceptions are the following query parameters which are not supported on requests into ARM and will cause the request to be rejected with a 400 status code:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `sub`\\r\\n- `subId`\\r\\n- `subscription`\\r\\n- `subscriptionId`\\n\\n## Case Insensitivity for Requests ##\\n\\nWhen satisfying incoming requests, it is assumed that the following values are stored / indexed / compared in a case **insensitive** way:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Resource group name\\r\\n- Resource name\\r\\n- Other names of entities in the URL, even if they are not resources.\\n\\n## Client Request Timeout ##\\n\\nRequests proxied to the resource provider are made with a client timeout of 60 seconds. If requests take more than 60 seconds please consider using asynchronous request/response pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resource provider must respond within that time interval or the client will receive a 504 (timeout) error code and will not see the response from the RP.\\n\\n## Request Throttling ##\\n\\nARM provides subscription level throttling. More details on these limits can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-subscription-service-limits/#overview).\\n\\n## Common API Response Details ##\\n\\n### Response Headers ###\\n\\nAll responses from resource providers should include the following headers:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Header | Description |\\r\\n| --- | --- |\\r\\n| `Content-Type` | Set to application/json. This header is not required in responses that don\\u0026#39;t have any content. |\\r\\n| `Date` | The date that the request was processed, in RFC 1123 format. |\\r\\n| `x-ms-request-id` | A unique identifier for the current operation, service generated. All the resource providers \\\\*must\\\\* return this value in the response headers to facilitate debugging. |\\r\\n| `x-ms-failurecause` | An ___optional___ header used to provide additional failure attribution on error responses.

This maps to implementation boundaries in ARM / the platform –RPs should not use this as their ActivityId.\\n\\n## ETags for Resources ##\\n\\nETags may be returned for individual resources, and then sent via If-Match / If-None-Match headers for concurrency control. The resource provider is responsible for storing and validating ETags – the frontdoor will never inspect these values.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behavior for ETags can be seen below:\\r\\n\\r\\n| PUT | Resource does not exist | Resource exists |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"\\\" / absent | 201 Created | 200 OK |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"\\\\*\\\" | 412* Precondition Failed | 200 OK |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"xyz\\\" | 412** Precondition Failed | 200 OK / 412 Precondition Failed |\\r\\n| If-None-Match = \\\"\\\\*\\\" | 201 Created | 412**** Precondition Failed |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| PATCH | Resource does not exist | Resource exists |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"\\\" / absent | 404 Not Found | 200 OK |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"\\\\*\\\" | 404** Not Found | 200 OK |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"xyz\\\" | 404** Not Found | 200 OK / 412 Precondition Failed |\\r\\n\\r\\n| DELETE | Resource does not exist | Resource exists |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"\\\" / absent | 204 No Content | 200 OK |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"\\\\*\\\" | 204*** No Content | 200 OK |\\r\\n| If-Match = \\\"xyz\\\" | 204*** No Content | 200 OK / 412 Precondition Failed |\\n\\n## Regional Endpoints ##\\n\\nThe Resource Provider should partition services across multiple regions in order to allow for continued service if there is a regional outage. It is recommended that the RP offer services in all Azure supported regions so that users may collocate interdependent resources within a resource group.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe RP should register all the regions that they support, and should provide a different regional endpoint for each region. This regional endpoint and its backing state/data should be isolated from the other regions in order to isolate failure within Azure. ARM will proxy the request to the appropriate region based on the resource\\u0026#39;s location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resource provider should register regional DNS names for each regional endpoint. The naming of this region should follow the below convention:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. {region}.{provider namespace}.azure.com\\r\\n2. {region}.{subservice name}.{provider namespace}.azure.com\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a concrete form:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. westus.cache.api.azure.com, eastus.cache.api.azure.com\\r\\n2. westus.redis.cache.api.azure.com\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a Resource Provider is creating resources on behalf of a customer the resource location should match the location of the resource group. This will co-locate the resource data in the RP and the resource metadata in ARM within the same region thus reducing the exposure to regional failures.\\n\\n## Resource Group Deletes ##\\n\\nIf the resource group containing resources is deleted, the RP will receive a DELETE call on each individual tracked resource in that group. In some cases, the resources will have interdependencies and therefore can only be deleted in a certain order that ARM does not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address this, ARM can simply ask each resource to delete in arbitrary order. If the resource refuses the deletion, then ARM will revisit it after trying to delete the rest of the group\\u0026#39;s resources. It will continue to revisit resources until all tracked resources are deleted, or there is no further delete progress (for example if a delete fails because of an ACL).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, it is essential that the RPs follow proper REST guidelines when returning 2xx for a successful delete, and 4xx for a delete that is invalid (until a related resource is deleted first).\\n\\n## Retrying REST Calls ##\\n\\nThe recommended pattern for REST clients is to retry calls that:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Return 408 indicating a request timeout;\\r\\n2. Return a 5xx status code indicating a server failure (e.g. 500 InternalServerError; 503 Service Unavailable);\\r\\n3. Experience a socket exception (e.g. DNS resolution failures; network drop; no listening socket).\\r\\n4. Any other response where a Retry-After header is present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retry interval, strategy (e.g. exponential/linear) and max timeout should be defined by the _server_ and not the client. The server indicates how long it expects the client to wait before retrying the call by including a (Retry-After header)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3] in the response. That allows various server workloads to advertise different retry policies.\\n\\n## Designing Resources ##\\n\\n3. If the objects have an independent lifetime but are not important to the model, they should only be top-level resources if no other design can be made to work.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Objects should be nested resources if:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. They meet the guidelines for Azure resources above (billable, orchestration supported, taggable)\\r\\n2. Their lifetime is dependent on a containing resource\\r\\n\\r\\n**Objects should be proxy only resources if:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. They don\\u0026#39;t need to be Azure resources for one of the reasons above\\r\\n2. if the objects/properties are required for the parent resource to be created, then they should \\\\*not\\\\* be Azure resources\\r\\n3. It is important that they be simple to create in context of a containing resource.\\r\\n4. The lifecycle of the resources are managed outside ARM (e.g. agent based discovery).\\r\\n5. They are very common and would incur a performance overhead on the system (for example by cluttering the indices and GET resources calls)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Comparison of Tracked Resources and proxy only Resources**\\r\\n\\r\\n| ​ **Feature** | ​ **Tracked Resources** | ​ **Proxy only Resources** |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| ​Understood by template processor | ​Yes | ​ Yes |\\r\\n| Can be top-level resource | Yes | Only if global/single region |\\r\\n| Defined JSON format to payload | ​Yes -- must comply with general Azure resource format (id, type, name, tags, properties, location etc.) | ​Yes -- must comply with general Azure resource format (id, type, name, properties, etc.) but no tags or location |\\r\\n| Defined URL format | ​Yes -- must use providers/{namespace}/{typename} URL | ​Yes -- must use providers/{namespace}/{typename} URL |\\r\\n| ​Tagging and Indexing supported | ​Yes | ​No |\\r\\n| ​Billing supported     | ​Yes | ​No |\\r\\n| ​Have their own URLs | ​Yes | ​Yes |\\r\\n| ​​Can be PUT (created) with the parent in a single call | ​No - $batch/deep insert not available | ​​Yes, see deep insert recommendation |\\r\\n| ​Supports RBAC | ​Yes -- based on URL     | ​ Yes -- based on URL |\\r\\n| ​\\n\\nThe Azure Resource Provider contract and template language have special semantics around \\u0026quot;registered\\u0026quot; Azure resources – we call these **tracked resources**.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf these objects are addressable by URIs but not \\\"registered\\\", we call these **proxy only** resources to differentiate them.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Background REST philosophy**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Azure API guideline compliant and OData compliant where it makes sense.\\r\\n2. APIs must be callable from any client implementation, language or framework.\\r\\n3. Making things simple and regular for machine processing often makes things easier for humans to understand, even when it increases verbosity.\\r\\n4. When we choose between understandable URLs and understandable templates, we should make the templates human understandable and the URLs machine consumable.\\r\\n5. Everything that is possible from a template should be possible through imperative APIs, but not necessarily as easily and may require special client code (orchestration is an obvious example).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Objects should be Tracked resources if:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

The error message 'Cannot find module prettier/plugins/estree' typically indicates that your local Prettier installation is missing required dependencies, or that the Prettier version installed does not match the expected one by the repo (especially with custom plugins like 'prettier-swagger-plugin.js').\\\\n\\\\nTo resolve this:\\\\n\\\\n1. Ensure you are using the correct Prettier version and that all dependencies are installed:\\\\n   - Run `git clean -xdf` in the root of your repo to remove all node_modules and build artifacts (note: this deletes all untracked files).\\\\n   - Run `npm ci` to install the exact versions specified in package-lock.json. This will ensure all required Prettier plugins (including any custom ones for Swagger) are installed.\\\\n\\\\n2. After installation, re-run your prettier command:\\\\n   - `npx prettier --write specification/maps/data-plane/Weather/stable/1.1/weather.json`\\\\n\\\\n3. If you still see errors, check that your repo is up to date:\\\\n   - Run `git pull` to ensure you have the latest scripts and configuration.\\\\n\\\\nIf problems persist, try cloning your repo into a new directory and repeat the steps above, as sometimes local environment issues can interfere.\\\\n\\\\nThis advice is consistent with the troubleshooting steps documented in the Azure REST API specs wiki for local validation and formatting. Prettier and its plugins must match what the CI expects, and a fresh npm install after cleaning out node_modules is the best way to ensure that.\\\\n\\\\nFor more details, refer to the 'Running Locally' section in the TypeSpec Validation wiki, which addresses similar issues for formatting and validation scripts.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"you should't need to install prettier yourself in any way.  Just run npm ci from the specs repo root.\\\\nIf you've installed prettier globally, using either npx prettier or npm install -g prettier, they might interfere.  I believe npm/npx are supposed to handle this, and prefer the local install from the specs repo, but maybe that wasn't happening on your dev machine.\\\"}\"}]",

            "inputs.response": "Based on the provided knowledge, the most common cause for being unable to push changes to a branch in the azure-rest-api-specs-pr repository (such as one off RPSaaSDev) is a lack of proper write access. Your suspicion that your Azure SDK Partners write access request may still be propagating is highly plausible. Write access is granted once you join the Azure SDK Partners team, and it can take up to one day after manager approval for permissions to propagate and be reflected in GitHub. \n\nBefore troubleshooting further, verify:\n- You have joined the Microsoft and Azure GitHub organizations, and your memberships are set to **Public**.\n- You have requested and received approval for Azure SDK Partners team membership.\n- It has been at least one business day since approval.\n\nIf all above steps are complete and the issue persists, try validating your alias with the [Validate-AzsdkCodeOwner](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/github/scripts/Validate-AzsdkCodeOwner.ps1) script. Also, note that some branches (like private `main`) are read-only, but RPSaaSDev is intended for dogfooding and should accept pushes if you have write access.\n\nIf the error message specifically references permissions (e.g., 'permission denied' or 'authentication failed'), it almost certainly means your write access is not yet active. If it has been more than one day since your access was approved, or if you have other permission-related issues, reach out via the [Azure SDK / Azure SDK Onboarding](https://aka.ms/azsdk/support/onboarding-channel) channel for assistance.\n\nOther causes for push errors can include branch protection policies, but these typically result in error messages about branch protection, not authentication or permission.

This is particularly interesting\\r\\nfor common infrastructure changes that are committed in the repo (i.e. github actions, tools, etc). Depending on how old your\\r\\nbranch is some of the pull request checks may not correctly function without taking a merge from main. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are working in a non-protected branch you can do a `git merge main` like you would normally do a merge and then push\\r\\nyour changes to your remote branch. However, if you are working in a branch with branch protection enabled (i.e. `release-*`) then\\r\\nyou will need to make a pull request to your branch with the merge. Depending on how out-of-date your branch is from `main` your \\r\\nmerge may have a lot of unwanted and unnecessary changes and the checks not pass. In such cases see below on how to [update the infrastructure](#updating-only-the-infrastructure-changes-from-main).\\n\\n### Updating only the infrastructure changes from main\\n\\nIn cases you need to only update the infrastructure code and not the specifications we have a helper pipeline \\r\\nwhich you can run that will create a pull request with a selective merge. The selective merge will include everything except for specs \\r\\nunder the specifications folder. This will enable you to only update the infrastructure and not other specs which should get your checks \\r\\npassing in your protected branch. Follow these steps to run the helper pipeline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e This should only be needed for protected branches, such as `release-*`. If you are in an unprotected branch, just use a normal `git merge main`.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Go to [tools - update-release-branch-in-specs](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7487) and select **Run Pipeline**.\\r\\nIf you don't have permission see [GitHub account linked with your Microsoft account](xref:access).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Enter the name of your branch in the **BranchToMergeTo** parameter. Usually this will be in the form `release-\\u003cname\\u003e`.  You shouldn't need to set \\r\\nthe other parameters but if your branch is in the private repo then you will need to update **Repo** to be `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr`.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Click the **Run** button.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The pipeline should only take a few minutes to run and once it is complete then go find the pull request it created. You can find a link to it in the \\r\\npipeline logs under the **Create Pull Request to merge** step. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Monitor the created pull request and approve it. Once the checks are green then merge the pull request and then your branch should be updated with the latest infrastructure changes.\\r\\nIf you have open PRs against your branch with failing checks, go to those PRs and retrigger the checks.

            "inputs.response": "This error occurs because in OpenAPI (and thus in TypeSpec's OpenAPI emitter), you cannot override or add additional properties (like `description`) directly on a `$ref` parameter in an operation. When you use a `$ref` to a parameter, you are importing the entire parameter object as-is; any attempt to add a property (such as a new `description`) to the reference creates an invalid OpenAPI structure and results in a schema violation. \n\nThis is different from objects/models: for schemas, you can use `allOf` to combine a `$ref` with additional properties (like overriding the description), but for parameters, OpenAPI does not allow this pattern. Parameters must be fully defined inline if you need to override anything (such as `description`, `example`, etc.).\n\n**How to achieve your goal in TypeSpec:**\n\nIf you need a custom description for a parameter in a single operation, you must define a new parameter (not just use the reference) for that operation, and apply the desired description:\n\n```tsp\n// Define your parameter with the custom description\n@query\n@doc(\"Custom description for typeahead for this operation only.\")\ntypeahead: string;\n\n// Use this in the operation's parameters instead of spreading the reference\nop searchAddress(\n  @path format: string,\n  @query typeahead: string, // <-- this uses the custom description\n  ... // other parameters\n): SearchResult;\n```\n\nThis way, only this operation gets the custom description, while all other operations using the original parameter reference are unaffected.\n\n**Why did it work for BoundingBoxCompassNotation?**\n\nFor schemas (objects), OpenAPI allows you to use `allOf` to extend or override properties, including documentation. For parameters, this is NOT allowed by the OpenAPI spec, and the emitter will fail validation if you try to add additional properties to a `$ref` parameter.\n\n**Summary:**\n- You cannot override a referenced parameter's description in OpenAPI (and TypeSpec) by adding properties to the `$ref`.\n- You must define a new parameter with the custom description for the specific operation where you want it.\n- For schemas (objects), overriding documentation via `allOf` works; for parameters, it does not.\n\nThis approach aligns with Azure API guidelines and OpenAPI standards.",

Resource types can be nested and, if so, must follow the Resource API guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\nARM does not distinguish between creation and replacement requests. The resource provider should consult its datastore if a distinction is necessary. A `Put` should always be allowed to overwrite an existing resource. An exception to this rule is when `x-ms-mutability ['create', 'read']` is applied to a property. For such properties, the value submitted during the create operation **must** be retained. Eg: The `location` property defined for tracked resources.\\n\\n### Request ###\\n\\n| Method | Request URI |\\r\\n| --- | --- |\\r\\n| Put | `https://\\u003cendpoint\\u003e/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}?api-version={api-version}` |\\r\\n\\r\\n**Arguments**\\r\\n\\r\\n[Common Arguments](#arguments-for-crud-on-resources).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resource group names and resource names should be matched case insensitively. For example, if a user creates a resource in resource group \\u0026quot;rG1\\u0026quot;, and then calls a read operation on \\u0026quot;RG1\\u0026quot;, the same resource should be returned even though the casing differs. Additionally, the Resource Provier **must** preserve the casing provided by the user. The service **must** return the most recently specified casing to the client and **must** not normalize or return a toupper or tolower form of the resource group or resource name. The resource group name and resource name **must** come from the URL and not the request body. These properties are considered **readOnly** in the request and response payloads.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Request Body**\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing are the top-level writeable properties that may be defined in the request payload of a `Put` operation. In addition to these writeable properties, it is a strong recommendation to also include the readOnly properties that are defined in the response of a `Get` operation for the same resource.

By using versioning decorators, you can specify when resources, operations, or properties are added, removed, or changed.\\n\\n## Declaring Versions\\n\\nDefine your API versions in an enum. For each version, specify dependencies and common types as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n/** Contoso API versions */\\r\\nenum Versions {\\r\\n  /** 2021-10-01-preview version */\\r\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\r\\n  v1,\\r\\n\\r\\n  /** 2022-11-01-preview version */\\r\\n  @armCommonTypesVersion(Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.Versions.v5)\\r\\n  v2,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter defining your enum, link it to your namespace using the `@versioned` decorator:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@versioned(Versions)\\r\\nnamespace Microsoft.ContosoProviderHub;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e **Note:** Add dependencies and common types for each version. After defining a new version, the emitter will produce outputs for all versions. You can then adapt your TypeSpec code for the latest version.\\n\\n## Simple Scenarios\\n\\nThese examples show how to add models, operations, properties, and parameters in specific versions using TypeSpec versioning decorators.\\n\\n### Adding Decoration to an Existing Type\\n\\nThis scenario demonstrates how to change a decorator’s usage across versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose you have a model property with a decorator:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\r\\n  experience: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next version (v2), the visibility changes so that the property can be read or created. To achieve this, you can use a combination of `@removed`, `@added`, and `@renamedFrom` decorators:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\r\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)\\r\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\"experience\\\")\\r\\n  oldExperience: string;\\r\\n\\r\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\r\\n  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read, Lifecycle.Create)\\r\\n  experience: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Adding a Parameter to an Operation and Making Another Parameter Optional\\n\\nThis scenario shows how to add a parameter and make another optional in an operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose you start with the following operation in v1:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@armResourceOperations\\r\\ninterface Employees {\\r\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\u003c\\r\\n    Employee,\\r\\n    Parameters = {\\r\\n      @header\\r\\n      location: string;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  \\u003e;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn version `v2`, you want to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Make the `location` header parameter optional.\\r\\n- Add a new optional query parameter `orderBy`.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can achieve this using the `@madeOptional` and `@added` decorators:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@armResourceOperations\\r\\ninterface Employees {\\r\\n  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription\\u003c\\r\\n    Employee,\\r\\n    Parameters = {\\r\\n      @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\r\\n      @header\\r\\n      location?: string;\\r\\n\\r\\n      @added(Versions.v2)\\r\\n      @query(\\\"order-by\\\")\\r\\n      orderBy?: string;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  \\u003e;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Explanation:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- `@madeOptional(Versions.v2)` makes `location` optional starting in v2.\\r\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the `orderBy` query parameter in v2 and later.\\n\\n### Converting an Operation from Synchronous to Asynchronous\\n\\nThis scenario illustrates converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one across versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose you start with the following synchronous operation in `v1`:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@armResourceOperations\\r\\ninterface Employees {\\r\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn version `v2`, you update this operation to be asynchronous as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@armResourceOperations\\r\\ninterface Employees {\\r\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\r\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\"createOrUpdate\\\")\\r\\n  @sharedRoute\\r\\n  createOrUpdateV1 is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceSync\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\n  @added(Versions.v2)\\r\\n  @sharedRoute\\r\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Explanation:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- `@removed(Versions.v2)` removes the original synchronous operation in v2 and later.\\r\\n- `@renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\"createOrUpdate\\\")` keeps the original name for v1.\\r\\n- `@added(Versions.v2)` adds the new asynchronous operation in v2 and later.\\r\\n- `@sharedRoute` ensures both operations can use the same route.\\n\\n## Versioning Decorators\\n\\n### @added\\n\\nYou can add new models, properties, or operations in a specific version and all subsequent versions using the `@added` decorator.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The `version` argument is the version where the element is introduced.\\r\\n- The element will be present in that version and all later versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Adding a model and property across versions**\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, suppose you want to add a new model and then add a property to it in a later version:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n// v1: No Employee model exists\\r\\n\\r\\n// v2: Add Employee model\\r\\n@added(Versions.v2)\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  name?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// v3: Add 'city' property to Employee\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  name: string;\\r\\n\\r\\n  @added(Versions.v3)\\r\\n  city?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Adding an operation in a later version**\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@armResourceOperations\\r\\ninterface Employees {\\r\\n  get is ArmResourceRead\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n  // v3: Add createOrUpdate operation\\r\\n  @added(Versions.v3)\\r\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n### @removed\\n\\nTo remove models, properties, or operations starting from a specific version, use the `@removed` decorator.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The `version` argument is the version where the element is removed.\\r\\n- The element will not be present in that version or any later versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Removing a property and a model across versions**\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n// v1: Employee model with 'city' property\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  name: string;\\r\\n  city?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// v2: Remove 'city' property\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  name: string;\\r\\n\\r\\n  @removed(Versions.v2)\\r\\n  city?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// v3: Remove Employee model entirely\\r\\n@removed(Versions.v3)\\r\\nmodel Employee {\\r\\n  name: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Removing an operation**\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n@armResourceOperations\\r\\ninterface Employees {\\r\\n  get is ArmResourceRead\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n  @removed(Versions.v3)\\r\\n  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync\\u003cEmployee\\u003e;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n### @madeRequired and @madeOptional\\n\\nUse these decorators to change whether a property is required or optional in a specific version.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Use `@madeOptional(Versions.version)` to make a property optional starting in that version.\\r\\n- Use `@madeRequired(Versions.version)` to make a property required starting in that version.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Changing a property from required to optional, then back to required**\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n// v1: movingStatus is required\\r\\nmodel MoveResponse {\\r\\n  movingStatus: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// v2: movingStatus becomes optional\\r\\nmodel MoveResponse {\\r\\n  @madeOptional(Versions.v2)\\r\\n  movingStatus?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n### @renamedFrom\\n\\nUse `@renamedFrom` to rename models, properties, operations, enums, etc., in a specific version.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The `version` argument is the version where the name changed.\\r\\n- The `oldName` argument is the previous name.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Renaming a property and a model across versions**\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\n// v1: Model and property have original names\\r\\nmodel WorkerProperties {\\r\\n  state?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// v2: Rename property 'state' to 'city'\\r\\nmodel WorkerProperties {\\r\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\"state\\\")\\r\\n  city?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// v3: Rename model 'WorkerProperties' to 'EmployeeProperties'\\r\\n@renamedFrom(Versions.v3, \\\"WorkerProperties\\\")\\r\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\r\\n  @renamedFrom(Versions.v2, \\\"state\\\")\\r\\n  city?: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### How do I version a pattern?\\n\\nI have this model and I would like to change the pattern in v2\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp\\r\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\r\\n  @pattern(\\\"^[a-z]+$\\\")\\r\\n  state: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n:::caution\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdating a pattern could be a breaking change:\\r\\n\\r\\n- A **more restrictive pattern** for input data would break existing clients that send previously valid data\\r\\n- A **less restrictive pattern** for output data could break client assumptions and validation logic\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key question is: **Does the pattern change apply to all API versions, or only to the new version?**\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Pattern changes for all versions\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the pattern change reflects how your service actually behaves across all versions, update the pattern directly. The specification should accurately reflect the current state of your service.\\r\\n\\r\\n```diff lang=tsp\\r\\nmodel EmployeeProperties {\\r\\n-  @pattern(\\\"^[a-z]+$\\\")\\r\\n+  @pattern(\\\"^[a-zA-Z]+$\\\")\\r\\n   state: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThis will update all openapi specs versions with the new pattern which is the desired behavior.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Different patterns per version (**Very unlikely**)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf older API versions truly enforce a different pattern than newer versions, you need to model this explicitly using versioning decorators:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\"},{\"document_source\":\"typespec_docs\",\"document_filename\":\"standard-library#examples.md\",\"document_title\":\"Examples\",\"document_link\":\"https://typespec.io/docs/standard-library/examples\",\"content\":\"# standard-library#examples.md\\n\\n# Examples\\n\\nTypeSpec provide 2 decorators `@example` and `@opExample` to provide some examples for the types and operations.\\r\\nWith those decorators the examples must be provided as TypeSpec values that should be assignable to the type or operation parameter/return types.\\n\\n### Type Examples\\n\\nTo give an example for a type you can use the `@example` decorator.

For more information on TypeSpec Azure, visit [here](https://aka.ms/typespec/azure).\\r\\n\\r\\n[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) is the new standard API definition language for Azure, developed by Microsoft. It is an open-source tool designed to generate OpenAPI specifications and other API description languages. TypeSpec can also produce client code, with service code generation in progress. TypeSpec offers highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST patterns used for Azure.\\n\\n## Benefits of TypeSpec\\n\\n- **Consistency across APIs**: TypeSpec ensures consistency across APIs by using high-level templates, reducing the need for repetitive tasks and minimizing errors. This uniform design approach acts as a single source of truth for API definitions, enhancing both consistency and quality.\\r\\n- **Efficiency and speed**: TypeSpec significantly reduces the amount of code needed to define API specifications. A ten-line code snippet in TypeSpec can generate a hundred lines of an OpenAPI specification, drastically reducing manual effort.\\r\\n- **Enhanced tooling**: TypeSpec comes with advanced tools that catch errors early, leading to more robust APIs. Additionally, extensions for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespecvs) and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typespec.typespec-vscode) aid in efficient TypeSpec creation.\\r\\n- **Accessibility**: The compact nature of TypeSpec, combined with its familiar JavaScript-style syntax, allows even non-technical stakeholders to participate in the API review and design process.\\n\\n## Case Studies\\n\\nHear directly from teams who have successfully transitioned to TypeSpec Azure and learn about their experiences:\\n\\n### Azure Batch\\n\\n[Case Study](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/AzureDeveloperExperience/EUkgwSc69lpPsBjQBfLfMEgB0WCTBe9x7ozU8VNK2s8mAw?e=1MIXZi)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"There's definitions in Swagger, but … TypeSpec has much more flexibility when it comes to doing things like mix or not mixing in traits and defining core things that you export.\\\"\\r\\n\\u003e \\\"I want to highlight the tooling improvements, like not having to figure out how to install things locally [like Swagger tooling], having it all in the same tool set that includes the emitters and things like that is really nice.

Furthermore, TypeSpec allows for the separate definition of models and routes. So, from my perspective, it's a superior choice at present.\\\"\\n\\n## Examples of TypeSpec Azure in Action\\n\\nWhether you're working with Data Plane (DP) or Azure Resource Manager (ARM), having clear examples to follow can make your transition to TypeSpec smoother.

I can get this from the compiler options when namespace is specified in the tspconfig.yaml. However, what should the behavior be when, as in the above config, the namespace isn't specified (for typespec-ts)?  What heuristic is applied to determine the namespace? Is it language specific?\\r\\n\\r\\n## answer\\r\\nWhen the `namespace` isn't explicitly specified in `tspconfig.yaml`, the behavior falls back to what's defined in the TypeSpec file itself—i.e., whatever `namespace` is declared there. If no namespace is declared in the TypeSpec, then the emitter determines the default, which may vary by language.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the management plane, it's fairly standardized: we derive the namespace based on the resource provider name, stripping prefixes like `Azure` or `Microsoft`, flattening separators, and applying language-specific naming conventions. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n* .NET: `Azure.ResourceManager.[ProviderName]`\\r\\n* Python: `azure-mgmt-[providername]`\\r\\n* Java: `com.azure.resourcemanager.[providername]`\\r\\n* JS: `@azure/arm-[providername]`\\r\\n\\r\\nFor **data plane**, it's similar but instead of \\\"ResourceManager\\\", you use the service group (like `AI`, `Data`, etc.). By default, it uses the namespace from the TypeSpec unless you override it via:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\n\\n`TypeSpec.Http.OkResponse` which causes problems in downstream. Can we remove this model? (omit-unreachable-types: true does not work)\\r\\n\\r\\n## answer\\r\\nIf the `OkResponse` model is being emitted but not actually referenced, that does sound like a bug — we shouldn't be generating unused models. Especially in cases like this where you're doing a long-running POST action and the 200 response is effectively empty, it’s more accurate to model the operation with just a `202` and an error response.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor your case, you can avoid using `OkResponse` entirely by switching to `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync` or passing `never` as the third argument. That will prevent the generation of the unnecessary `OkResponse` model.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, keep in mind that for LROs, the POST operation typically doesn't return 200 anyway. That response is just a placeholder in the old pattern to signal \\\"void\\\". If you're converting from existing Swagger, and it doesn’t actually return 200, you should be able to safely drop that response from the Swagger and avoid the breaking change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, if you do need to customize the final response for the LRO, `getLroResponse` can be used to override the response returned at the end of the operation — no need to rely on `OkResponse` at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n# TSP Install fails with below error\\r\\n\\r\\n## question \\r\\nI am trying to install TSP and its dependencies and it fails with below error.

Generally though, this should not be a concern.\\r\\nTag name changes:  tags can affect Terraform.

You can still add summary documentation for other consumers of the specs using the @summary decorator\\n\\nFor one thing. the most important thing for the spec is that is accurately represents the API.  There is client decoration available in many cases to keep the sdk from breaking as we make sure the API is accurate:\\r\\nx-ms-skip-url-encoding:  Parameters like 'scope'  and 'resourceUri'  generally contain multiple path segments.  If they occur in a path parameter, you almost always want those path segments included in the path, so skipping url; encoding is appropriate.  If they occur in query parameters, then url encoding is irrelevant.  You can specificall set url encoding for path parameters by decorating with @path(#{allowReserved: true})\\r\\nThe value array.  Generally, the Value array occurs in list types, which also have a nextLink.  No more properties should mean no more nextLink.  It is almost always the case in actual practice that value always occurs in list responses, and this was a piece of inaccurate variance in the original spec.  The best practice is to validate that your service can have a response that does not contain a value property (which is unlikely), and only change the response type then.  Whether or not this is the case, it is highly unlikely to have any impact on clients, which have standard mechaniisms for handling paged types.\\r\\nSingle OpenAPI file:  Teams no longer maintain the OpenAPI spec, they maintain the TypeSpec as the source of truth and OpenApi is generated from that, so the layout of the OpenAPI files should not be important going forward, except in some limited cases (for example, some teams have special configuration for PowerShell cmdlets that only generate cmdlets for some of their OpenApi specs).

When you use a `$ref` to a parameter, you are importing the entire parameter object as-is; any attempt to add a property (such as a new `description`) to the reference creates an invalid OpenAPI structure and results in a schema violation. \\\\n\\\\nThis is different from objects/models: for schemas, you can use `allOf` to combine a `$ref` with additional properties (like overriding the description), but for parameters, OpenAPI does not allow this pattern. Parameters must be fully defined inline if you need to override anything (such as `description`, `example`, etc.).\\\\n\\\\n**How to achieve your goal in TypeSpec:**\\\\n\\\\nIf you need a custom description for a parameter in a single operation, you must define a new parameter (not just use the reference) for that operation, and apply the desired description:\\\\n\\\\n```tsp\\\\n// Define your parameter with the custom description\\\\n@query\\\\n@doc(\\\\\\\"Custom description for typeahead for this operation only.\\\\\\\")\\\\ntypeahead: string;\\\\n\\\\n// Use this in the operation's parameters instead of spreading the reference\\\\nop searchAddress(\\\\n  @path format: string,\\\\n  @query typeahead: string, // <-- this uses the custom description\\\\n  ... // other parameters\\\\n): SearchResult;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis way, only this operation gets the custom description, while all other operations using the original parameter reference are unaffected.\\\\n\\\\n**Why did it work for BoundingBoxCompassNotation?**\\\\n\\\\nFor schemas (objects), OpenAPI allows you to use `allOf` to extend or override properties, including documentation. For parameters, this is NOT allowed by the OpenAPI spec, and the emitter will fail validation if you try to add additional properties to a `$ref` parameter.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- You cannot override a referenced parameter's description in OpenAPI (and TypeSpec) by adding properties to the `$ref`.\\\\n- You must define a new parameter with the custom description for the specific operation where you want it.\\\\n- For schemas (objects), overriding documentation via `allOf` works; for parameters, it does not.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach aligns with Azure API guidelines and OpenAPI standards.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"You should be able to workaround this be slightly refactoring your swagger, for example create a new parameter TypeaheadDeprecated with the new description.\\\"}\"}]",

Now my questions:\nI want this to be updated in current documentation posted online, as well as SDK docs. How do I submit this change against main or the latest feature branch?

Documentation/comments (docstrings) in TypeSpec models are emitted into both the generated OpenAPI/Swagger and SDK docs, provided you compile with TypeSpec and check in the results. No special versioning is required for doc-only changes—just update the comments in your TypeSpec source and recompile.\n\n**How to submit the change:**\n- Submit your PR against `main` in the azure-rest-api-specs repo. This is the standard branch for public documentation and SDK generation, unless your team is actively working in a feature branch that is not yet merged to main.\n- Make sure your PR only includes the updated TypeSpec source and the newly compiled Swagger (OpenAPI JSON files), plus examples if changed.\n- No additional work is needed to propagate the changes to SDKs—the docstrings will be picked up automatically in the next SDK generation cycle once the PR is merged.\n\n**Resolving the CI error: \"The default tag contains multiple API versions swaggers\":**\n- This error is caused by the presence of more than one OpenAPI file in the default tag for the API version. This is a hard blocker in the TypeSpec migration pipeline, and you must resolve it before your doc-only update can be accepted.\n- To fix this, ensure that only one OpenAPI file is present in the default tag. Remove any additional swagger files from the default tag in the readme configuration (usually `readme.md`). For more details, refer to the guidance: https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/issues/2194#issue-2844564216\n- If you are unsure which file should be kept, keep only the latest stable or preview version intended for public documentation and SDK generation.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Make docstring changes in TypeSpec source, recompile, and submit against main.\n- Remove any duplicate OpenAPI files from the default tag to resolve the CI error.\n- No extra steps needed for SDK propagation; documentation changes do not trigger new SDK releases unless API surface changes are made.\n\nIf you need more help with migration conflicts, see: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Resolving-Folder-Migration-Conflicts:-A-Guide-for-PR-Authors\nAnd for validation steps: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/TypeSpec-Validation",

Depending on how out-of-date your branch is from `main` your \\r\\nmerge may have a lot of unwanted and unnecessary changes and the checks not pass. In such cases see below on how to [update the infrastructure](#updating-only-the-infrastructure-changes-from-main).\\n\\n### Updating only the infrastructure changes from main\\n\\nIn cases you need to only update the infrastructure code and not the specifications we have a helper pipeline \\r\\nwhich you can run that will create a pull request with a selective merge. The selective merge will include everything except for specs \\r\\nunder the specifications folder. This will enable you to only update the infrastructure and not other specs which should get your checks \\r\\npassing in your protected branch. Follow these steps to run the helper pipeline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e This should only be needed for protected branches, such as `release-*`. If you are in an unprotected branch, just use a normal `git merge main`.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

You shouldn't need to set \\r\\nthe other parameters but if your branch is in the private repo then you will need to update **Repo** to be `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr`.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Click the **Run** button.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The pipeline should only take a few minutes to run and once it is complete then go find the pull request it created. You can find a link to it in the \\r\\npipeline logs under the **Create Pull Request to merge** step. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Monitor the created pull request and approve it. Once the checks are green then merge the pull request and then your branch should be updated with the latest infrastructure changes.\\r\\nIf you have open PRs against your branch with failing checks, go to those PRs and retrigger the checks.

In this section, we'll introduce you to TypeSpec, help you set up your development environment, and cover the basic syntax and structure of TypeSpec. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon in the subsequent sections.\\n\\n### What is TypeSpec?\\n\\nTypeSpec is a language and toolset developed by Microsoft for defining data models and service APIs. It provides a structured way to describe the shape and behavior of data and services, ensuring consistency and reducing errors in API development. With TypeSpec, you can generate code, documentation, and other artifacts from your API definitions, making it easier to maintain and evolve your services. Microsoft uses TypeSpec internally to define APIs for various products and services, including Azure.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypeSpec is used to define the **interface** of your API, which clients will use to interact with resources provided by your service. This includes specifying the operations, request and response models, and error handling mechanisms. The actual API logic is implemented in the backend service, which processes the requests and communicates with the database.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we start writing TypeSpec code, we need to set up our development environment. For detailed instructions on setting up your environment, please refer to the [Installation Guide](../../../).\\n\\n### Summary of Setup and Installation\\n\\n1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm, the Node.js package manager. The minimum versions required are Node.js 20.0.0 and npm 7.0.0.\\r\\n2. **Install TypeSpec CLI**: Run `npm install -g @typespec/compiler` to install the TypeSpec CLI.\\r\\n3. **Verify Installation**: Run `tsp --version` to verify that the TypeSpec CLI is installed correctly.\\r\\n4. **Create a New Project**:\\r\\n   - Run `tsp init` and select the `Generic REST API` template.\\r\\n   - Run `tsp install` to install dependencies.\\r\\n   - Run `tsp compile .` to compile the initial file.\\r\\n   - Run `tsp compile . --watch` to automatically compile changes on save.\\n\\n### Project Structure Overview\\n\\nOnce you've completed these steps, you'll have a basic TypeSpec project set up. Here's an overview of the files and directories in your TypeSpec project:\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* prettier-ignore */}\\r\\n\\u003cFileTree\\u003e\\r\\n- main.tsp\\r\\n- tspconfig.yaml\\r\\n- package.json\\r\\n- node_modules/\\r\\n- tsp-output/\\r\\n  - @typespec/\\r\\n    - openapi3/\\r\\n      - openapi.yaml\\r\\n\\u003c/FileTree\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n- **main.tsp**: Entry point for TypeSpec definitions.\\r\\n- **tspconfig.yaml**: TypeSpec compiler configuration.\\r\\n- **package.json**: Project metadata and dependencies.\\r\\n- **node_modules/**: Installed dependencies.\\r\\n- **tsp-output/**: Generated files.\\r\\n- **openapi.yaml**: Generated OpenAPI specification.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we work through the tutorial, keep the openapi.yaml file open in Visual Studio or VS Code to watch the API specification evolve as we make changes.\\n\\n## Basic Syntax and Structure\\n\\nNow that we have our environment set up, let's dive into the basic syntax and structure of TypeSpec. We'll create a simple REST API for a pet store by introducing concepts in a layered fashion, increasing complexity as we progress through the tutorial.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the tutorial advances and the code examples grow more complex, we'll highlight changes in the code to help you easily spot where new lines have been added.\\n\\n### Import and Using Statements\\n\\nBefore defining models and services, we need to import the necessary TypeSpec libraries and make them available in our namespace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we progress through the tutorial, you can follow along by updating the `main.tsp` file in your project and compiling the changes to see the results reflected in the generated `openapi.yaml` specification.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also alternatively use the `Try it` feature with the code samples to quickly view the generated OpenAPI spec in your browser via the TypeSpec Playground.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's begin by adding the following import and using statements to the `main.tsp` file:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsp title=main.tsp tryit=\\\"{\\\"emit\\\": [\\\"@typespec/openapi3\\\"]}\\\"\\r\\nimport \\\"@typespec/http\\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nusing Http;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this example:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `import` statement brings in the [TypeSpec HTTP library](../../../libraries/http/reference/), which provides the decorators and models we'll be using to define our REST API.\\r\\n- `using` statement makes the imported library available in the current namespace, allowing us to use its features and decorators.\\r\\n\\r\\n**NOTE: Your generated project file likely already has these import/using statements, plus import/using for the `@typespec/openapi3` library. The `@typespec/openapi3` library is necessary for emitting the OpenAPI specification file but is not required for creating our Pet Store API in TypeSpec. Remove them from your `main.tsp` file so your code matches the example above.**\\r\\n\\r\\n## Defining a REST Service\\r\\n\\r\\nA REST service in TypeSpec is defined using the [`@service`](../../../standard-library/built-in-decorators/#@service) decorator. This decorator allows you to specify metadata about your service, such as its title. Additionally, you can use the [`@server`](../../../libraries/http/reference/decorators/#@TypeSpec.Http.server) decorator to define the server endpoint where your service will be hosted.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example: Defining a Service with a Title and Server Endpoint\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's start by defining a simple REST service for a Pet Store:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\"},{\"document_source\":\"static_typespec_qa\",\"document_filename\":\"typespec_2025_07_03.md\",\"document_title\":\"Avocado error after @renamedFrom on custom action route\",\"document_link\":\"\",\"content\":\"# typespec_2025_07_03.md\\n\\n# Avocado error after @renamedFrom on custom action route\\n\\n## question\\n\\nFor PR [Add Microsoft.Mission version 2025-05-01-preview - Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/pull/22581) I was asked to consider renaming routes for some custom actions to meet naming conventions.

I am guessing those changes were made by the TypeSpec team and I am also guessing that if I manage to properly update tools, the errors should go away. \\r\\nSo, is there a single document that describes how to update the environment to the latest?\\n\\n## answer\\n\\nThe issue you're facing is related to updating your local TypeSpec environment. Here's a summary of the solution:\\r\\nUpdate Local Dependencies:\\r\\nRunning npm install -g @typespec/compiler only updates the global TypeSpec compiler, which is not typically used for local development unless you need access to TypeSpec commands globally.\\r\\nTo properly update your local environment, navigate to your repository and run npm ci. This command installs the exact versions of dependencies specified in the package-lock.json, ensuring consistency.\\r\\nTypeSpec Versions in Repositories:\\r\\nWhen working with repositories like azure-rest-api-specs, you should always install dependencies based on the local package.json and package-lock.json at the root of your branch. This ensures you're using the correct version of TypeSpec and associated tools for your current project.\\r\\nDealing with Configuration Warnings:\\r\\nThe warnings you're seeing (such as missing options for SDK emitters) are configuration-related, not errors. These warnings appear when SDK emitters for specific languages (like Go, Python, C#) are not installed, but they do not affect your immediate work with TypeSpec validation. These can be safely ignored unless you need to work with SDK generation.\\r\\nSuppression and Documentation:\\r\\nIf you want to suppress specific warnings, you can modify the suppressions.yaml file, but it's important to follow the TypeSpec guidelines to ensure proper environment configuration.\"},{\"document_source\":\"static_typespec_qa\",\"document_filename\":\"typespec_2025_06_26.md\",\"document_title\":\"Typespec Validation required check\",\"document_link\":\"\",\"content\":\"# typespec_2025_06_26.md\\n\\n# Typespec Validation required check\\n\\n## question\\n\\n\\\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/{module-name}\\\" does not match \\\"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/{service-dir}/{package-dir}\\\".

            "inputs.response": "Yes, Azure ARM (management plane) SDKs can pass OData-style query parameters such as `$filter`, `$orderby`, and `$search` to enable server-side filtering, sorting, and searching on list operations, mirroring what is supported by the REST APIs. This is a standard pattern for ARM resource providers and is required by the ARM RPC contract for collection/list operations.\n\nTo ensure SDKs expose these query parameters:\n- In your API specification (ideally using TypeSpec), define these query parameters on your list operations using the appropriate decorators and traits.\n- For TypeSpec, Azure provides standard models and traits for OData query parameters (like `FilterQueryParameter`, `OrderByQueryParameter`, and `StandardListQueryParameters`) in the `Azure.Core` library. These can be composed into list operations via traits, so SDK generators will surface them as arguments in the generated SDK methods.\n- When you use these traits, the generated SDK methods for list operations will include parameters for `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, etc. This enables consumers to pass these values in SDK calls, and they will be sent as query parameters in the HTTP requests.\n\nExample TypeSpec usage:\n```typespec\nimport \"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core\";\nusing Azure.Core;\nusing Azure.Core.Traits;\n\nop listWidgets is Azure.Core.ResourceList<\n  Widget,\n  ListQueryParametersTrait<StandardListQueryParameters & FilterQueryParameter & OrderByQueryParameter>\n>;\n```\n\nThis will generate SDK methods with arguments for filtering, sorting, and pagination, matching the REST API behavior.\n\n**Summary:** As long as your API spec declares the OData query parameters on the list operation, the SDKs generated for Azure ARM will expose them as method arguments.

Customizing operations with traits\",\"document_link\":\"https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/azure-core/step09\",\"content\":\"# getstarted#azure-core#step09.md\\n\\n# 9. Customizing operations with traits\\n\\nFor all standard lifecycle operations you can customize the operation parameters and response body by passing a special model type to the `Traits` parameter of the operation template, typically the second parameter of the operation template. You can also customize the whole set of resource operations by passing traits to the `ResourceOperations` interface.\\r\\nYou can combine multiple traits using the model intersection operator `\\u0026`. Here's an example of defining the `ServiceTraits` with `SupportsRepeatableRequests`, `SupportsConditionalRequests` and `SupportsClientRequestId`. These are then passed into the `Azure.Core.ResourceOperations` template:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nimport \\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core\\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nusing Azure.Core;\\r\\nusing Azure.Core.Traits;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias ServiceTraits = SupportsRepeatableRequests \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsConditionalRequests \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsClientRequestId;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias Operations = Azure.Core.ResourceOperations\\u003cServiceTraits\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\r\\nTraits can be applied simultaneously at both the interface and operation level, they will be composed together when your operation is defined.\\r\\nFor example, if you wanted to add standard list operation query parameters to the `listWidgets` operation, you could use the `ListQueryParametersTrait`:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\n/** List Widget resources */\\r\\nop listWidgets is Operations.ResourceList\\u003c\\r\\n  Widget,\\r\\n  ListQueryParametersTrait\\u003cStandardListQueryParameters \\u0026 SelectQueryParameter\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\n\\n## Useful trait types\\n\\nThe following trait types can be used for typical operation customization patterns:\\n\\n### `QueryParametersTrait\\u003cTParams, Contexts\\u003e`\\n\\nThis trait adds query parameters to operation signatures. It accepts a model type containing the query parameters that will be mixed in to the operation signature:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nop getWidget is Operations.ResourceRead\\u003c\\r\\n  Widget,\\r\\n  QueryParametersTrait\\u003c{\\r\\n    @query foo: string;\\r\\n  }\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\u003e **NOTE**: All properties in `TParams` must be marked with `@query` or an error will be raised.\\r\\nThe `Contexts` parameter is configured to apply the query parameters to all operations by default.\\r\\nTo constrain the types of operations that these query parameters will apply to, pass one ore more of the following values:\\r\\n- **TraitContext.Read**: Applies to read operations\\r\\n- **TraitContext.Create**: Applies to create operations\\r\\n- **TraitContext.Update**: Applies to update operations\\r\\n- **TraitContext.Delete**: Applies to delete operations\\r\\n- **TraitContext.List**: Applies to list operations\\r\\n- **TraitContext.Action**: Applies to custom action operations\\r\\nHere is an example of applying query parameters to `Read` and `List` operations:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nalias MyQueryParams = QueryParametersTrait\\u003c\\r\\n  {\\r\\n    @query foo: string;\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  TraitContext.Read | TraitContext.List\\r\\n\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\n// This will have a `foo` parameter added\\r\\nop getWidget is Operations.ResourceRead\\u003cWidget, MyQueryParams\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\n// This will not get the `foo` parameter because it doesn't match the contexts\\r\\nop deleteWidget is Operations.ResourceDelete\\u003cWidget, MyQueryParams\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\n\\n### `ListQueryParametersTrait\\u003cTParams\\u003e`\\n\\nThis is a helper trait that specialized `QueryParametersTrait` to the `TraitContext.List` context. For example:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nalias MyListQueryParams = ListQueryParametersTrait\\u003c{\\r\\n  @query foo: string;\\r\\n}\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\n// Will get the `foo` parameter\\r\\nop listWidgets is Operations.ResourceList\\u003cWidget, MyListQueryParams\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\n// Will not get the `foo` parameter\\r\\nop deleteWidget is Operations.ResourceDelete\\u003cWidget, MyListQueryParams\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\n\\n### `RequestHeadersTrait\\u003cTParams, Contexts\\u003e`\\n\\nThis trait adds request headers to operation signatures. It accepts a model type containing the request headers that will be mixed in to the operation signature:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nop getWidget is ResourceRead\\u003c\\r\\n  Widget,\\r\\n  RequestHeadersTrait\\u003c{\\r\\n    @header foo: string;\\r\\n  }\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\u003e **NOTE**: All properties in `TParams` must be marked with `@header` or an error will be raised.\\r\\nYou can specify `Contexts` where this trait applies in the way as described for the `QueryParametersTrait`.\\n\\n### `ResponseHeadersTrait\\u003cTParams, Contexts\\u003e`\\n\\nThis trait adds response headers to operation signatures. It accepts a model type containing the response headers that will be mixed in to the operation signature:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nop getWidget is ResourceRead\\u003c\\r\\n  Widget,\\r\\n  ResponseHeadersTrait\\u003c{\\r\\n    @header foo: string;\\r\\n  }\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\u003e **NOTE**: All properties in `TParams` must be marked with `@header` or an error will be raised.\\r\\nYou can specify `Contexts` where this trait applies in the way as described for the `QueryParametersTrait`.\\n\\n## Applying traits to all resource operations\\n\\nIf you would like to apply the same traits to all resource operations, you can do so by adding them to the traits object for your instance of the `ResourceOperations` interface. Here's an example of adding a request header called `foo` to all resource operations:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nimport \\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core\\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nusing Azure.Core;\\r\\nusing Azure.Core.Traits;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias ServiceTraits = SupportsRepeatableRequests \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsConditionalRequests \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsClientRequestId \\u0026\\r\\n  RequestHeadersTrait\\u003c{\\r\\n    @header foo: string;\\r\\n  }\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias Operations = ResourceOperations\\u003cServiceTraits\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\nop deleteWidget is Operations.ResourceDelete\\u003cWidget\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis defines `deleteWidget` by using the `ResourceDelete` template defined inside of your customized `Operations` interface.\\r\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The `ResourceOperations` interface requires that an explicit set of traits be included to describe whether certain Azure service features are supported.\\r\\nHere is the list of the required traits with the names of the trait models to enable and disable those features:\\r\\n- **RepeatableRequests**: `SupportsRepeatableRequests` and `NoRepeatableRequests`\\r\\n- **ConditionalRequests**: `SupportsConditionalRequests` and `NoConditionalRequests`\\r\\n- **ClientRequestId**: `SupportsClientRequestId` and `NoClientRequestId`\\n\\n## Customizing the API version parameter\\n\\nYou can use the `VersionParameterTrait` to customize the API version parameter for resource operations, either at the level of interface or individual operation. To do this, use the `TraitOverride` type to override the existing `api-version` query parameter:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\n/** The ApiVersion path parameter. */\\r\\nmodel ApiVersionPathParameter {\\r\\n  /** The API version to use for this operation. */\\r\\n  @segment(\\\"api\\\")\\r\\n  @path(\\\"api-version\\\")\\r\\n  apiVersion: string;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nop deleteWidget is ResourceDelete\\u003c\\r\\n  Widget,\\r\\n  TraitOverride\\u003cVersionParameterTrait\\u003cApiVersionPathParameter\\u003e\\u003e\\r\\n\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\r\\nUsing the `TraitOverride` modifier with the `VersionParameterTrait\\u003cApiVersionPathParameter\\u003e` causes any existing `VersionParameterTrait` instances in the operation signature to be overridden by the one you have supplied.\\r\\nThis will result in an operation that has the route path `/api/{apiVersion}/widgets/{widgetName}` while also removing the old `api-version` query parameter from the operation signature.\\n\\n## Versioning the use of traits\\n\\nIt is possible that a service will begin to support a particular feature or trait in a later version. There are two ways to express that a trait is being added in a later service version:\\n\\n### Using the `TVersionAdded` parameter of some trait types\\n\\n\\u003e **NOTE:** Versioning of Azure Core service specifications is covered in more detail on [this page](https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/azure-core/step10).\\r\\nSome standard trait types accept an optional `TVersionAdded` parameter which enables you to specify the service version enum representing the version where support for this trait is added:\\r\\n- `SupportsClientRequestId`\\r\\n- `SupportsRepeatableRequests`\\r\\n- `SupportsConditionalRequests`\\r\\nHere is an example of adding support for repeatable requests in a later service version:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\nimport \\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core\\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nusing Azure.Core;\\r\\nusing Azure.Core.Traits;\\r\\nusing Versioning;\\r\\n\\r\\n@service(#{ title: \\\"Contoso Widget Manager\\\" })\\r\\n@versioned(Contoso.WidgetManager.Versions)\\r\\nnamespace Contoso.WidgetManager;\\r\\n\\r\\nenum Versions {\\r\\n  v2022_08_31: \\\"v20220831\\\",\\r\\n  v2022_11_30: \\\"v20221130\\\",\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nalias ServiceTraits = SupportsRepeatableRequests\\u003cVersions.v2022_11_30\\u003e \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsConditionalRequests \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsClientRequestId;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias Operations = ResourceOperations\\u003cServiceTraits\\u003e;\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Define a custom trait and add the `@traitAdded` decorator\\n\\nBuilding on the previous example, we can add a custom header trait at a later service version using the `@traitAdded` decorator:\\r\\n```typespec\\r\\n/** A custom trait added at a later service version. */\\r\\n@traitAdded(Versions.v2022_11_30)\\r\\nmodel CustomRequestHeadersTrait\\r\\n  is RequestHeadersTrait\\u003c{\\r\\n    @TypeSpec.Http.header foo: string;\\r\\n  }\\u003e;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias ServiceTraits = SupportsRepeatableRequests\\u003cVersions.v2022_11_30\\u003e \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsConditionalRequests \\u0026\\r\\n  SupportsClientRequestId \\u0026\\r\\n  CustomRequestHeadersTrait;\\r\\n\\r\\nalias Operations = ResourceOperations\\u003cServiceTraits\\u003e;\\r\\n```\"},{\"document_source\":\"azure_sdk_for_go_docs\",\"document_filename\":\"development#README.md\",\"document_title\":\"Development Documentation\",\"document_link\":\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/blob/main/documentation/development/README.md\",\"content\":\"# development#README.md\\n\\n# Development Documentation\\n\\nThis folder contains details on how to generate a Go SDK using the TypeSpec code generator.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment Flow:\\r\\n* [Set Up](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/setup.md)\\r\\n* [Generate SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/generate.md)\\r\\n* [Test SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/testing.md)\\r\\n* [Release SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/release.md)\\r\\n\\r\\nOther folders and files:\\r\\n* [ARM](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/ARM)- Azure Resource Manager/management-plane SDK specific documentation (i.e. modules with the `arm` prefix)\\r\\n* [breaking-changes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/breaking-changes)- guide for breaking code changes plus how to deprecate a module\\r\\n* [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation/development/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)- troubleshooting code generation issues\"},{\"document_source\":\"azure_sdk_for_python_docs\",\"document_filename\":\"dev#mgmt#tests.md\",\"document_title\":\"Table of contents\",\"document_link\":\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/mgmt/tests.md\",\"content\":\"# dev#mgmt#tests.md\\n\\n# Table of contents\\n\\n-   [Overview](#overview)\\r\\n-   [Getting the tests to run](#running-the-tests)\\r\\n    -   [Setting up a test environment](#setting-up-a-test-environment)\\r\\n    -   [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)\\r\\n    -   [Getting Azure credentials](#getting-azure-credentials)\\r\\n        -   [Get a token with Active Directory application and service principal](#get-a-token-with-active-directory-application-and-service-principal)\\r\\n    -   [Providing credentials to the tests](#providing-credentials-to-the-tests)\\r\\n    -   [Running tests in live mode](#running-tests-in-live-mode)\\r\\n- [Using the Azure Python SDK test framework](#writing-new-tests)\\r\\n\\r\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All the commands in this page assumes you have loaded the [dev_setup][dev_setup] in your currently loaded virtual environment.\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThis page is to help you write tests for Azure Python SDK when these tests require Azure HTTP requests. The Azure SDK test framework uses the [`azure-sdk-tools`][azure_sdk_tools] package, which in turn rests upon on a HTTP recording system ([testproxy][testproxy]) that enables tests dependent on network interaction to be run offline.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this document, we will describe:\\r\\n-   [How to run the tests online (by authenticating with Azure to record new HTTP interactions)](#running-tests-in-live-mode)\\r\\n-   [How to run the tests offline (using previously recorded HTTP interactions)](#running-tests-in-playback-mode)\\r\\n-   [How to write new tests using our utility classes](#writing-new-tests)\\n\\n# Getting the tests to run\\n\\nThis section describes how to run the SDK tests, by installing dependencies into a virtual environment and using a helper script and the [pytest][pytest] test runner to choose which tests to run.\\n\\n## Running the tests\\n\\nIn this section, we will be running the tests in `azure-mgmt-storage`. Azure SDK tests use [pytest][pytest] test runner. To run all the tests, you can use the following command:\\r\\n\\r\\n```Shell\\r\\nsdk/storage/azure-mgmt-storage\\u003e pytest\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can provide directories or individual files as positional arguments to specify particular tests to run rather than running the entire test suite. For example:\\r\\n```Shell\\r\\nsdk/storage/azure-mgmt-storage\\u003e pytest\\r\\nsdk/storage/azure-mgmt-storage\\u003e pytest tests/test_mgmt_storage.py\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have print statements in your tests for debugging you can add the `-s` flag to send those print statements to standard output:\\r\\n```Shell\\r\\nsdk/storage/azure-mgmt-storage\\u003e pytest -s\\r\\n```\\n\\n## Getting Azure credentials\\n\\nThere are several ways to authenticate to Azure, but to be able to record test HTTP interactions, you must use an OAuth authentication method which gives you a token:\\r\\n- Active Directory application and service principal\\n\\n### Get a token with Active Directory application and service principal\\n\\nFollow this detailed tutorial to set up an Active Directory application and service principal:\\r\\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal\\r\\n\\r\\nTo use the credentials from Python, you need:\\r\\n* Application ID (a.k.a. client ID)\\r\\n* Authentication key (a.k.a. client secret)\\r\\n* Tenant ID\\r\\n* Subscription ID from the Azure portal\\r\\n[This section of the above tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in) describes where to find them (besides the subscription ID, which is in the \\\"Overview\\\" section of the \\\"Subscriptions\\\" blade.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recommended practice is to store these three values in environment variables called `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`. To set an environment variable use the following commands:\\r\\n```Shell\\r\\n$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID='\\u003cvalue\\u003e'        # PowerShell only\\r\\nset AZURE_TENANT_ID=\\u003cvalue\\u003e         # Windows CMD (alternatively, use export AZURE_TENANT_ID=\\u003cvalue\\u003e to export to the global env)\\r\\nexport AZURE_TENANT_ID=\\u003cvalue\\u003e      # Linux shell only\\r\\n```\\r\\n*** Note: when setting these variables, do not wrap the value in quotation marks ***\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are now able to log in from Python using OAuth. Before use, you need to run the `pip install azure-identity` command to install it.\\r\\nYou can test with this code:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport os\\r\\nfrom azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential\\r\\n\\r\\ncredentials = ClientSecretCredential(\\r\\n    client_id = os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'],\\r\\n    secret = os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'],\\r\\n    tenant = os.environ['AZURE_TENANT_ID']\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\nOr you can use `DefaultAzureCredential`, which we prefer.\\r\\nYou can test with this code:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport os\\r\\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\\r\\n\\r\\ncredentials = DefaultAzureCredential()\\r\\n```\\n\\n## Providing credentials to the tests\\n\\nWhen you run tests in playback mode, they use a fake credentials file, located at [`eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools/devtools_testutils/mgmt_settings_fake.py`][mgmt_settings_fake], to simulate authenticating with Azure. In most scenarios you will not have to adjust this file, you will have to make edits to this file if your service uses values that are not already included in the `mgmt_settings_fake.py` file.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn live mode, you need to use real credentials like those you obtained in the previous section. To enable the tests to use them, make a copy of the `mgmt_settings_fake.py` file in the same location, and rename it `mgmt_settings_real.py`.\\r\\nThen make the following changes:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Change the value of the `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` constant to your subscription ID. (If you don't have it, you can find it in the \\\"Overview\\\" section of the \\\"Subscriptions\\\" blade in the [Azure portal][azure_portal].)\\r\\n* Change the `get_azure_core_credential()` function to construct and return a `ClientSecretCredential`:\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndef get_azure_core_credential(**kwargs):\\r\\n    from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential\\r\\n    import os\\r\\n    return ClientSecretCredential(\\r\\n        client_id = os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'],\\r\\n        client_secret = os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'],\\r\\n        tenant_id = os.environ['AZURE_TENANT_ID']\\r\\n    )\\r\\n```\\r\\n* Or you could use the `get_credential()` function to construct and return a `DefaultAzureCredential`:\\r\\n```\\r\\ndef get_credential(**kwargs):\\r\\n    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\\r\\n    return DefaultAzureCredential()\\r\\n```\\r\\nThese two methods are used by the authentication methods within `AzureTestCase` to provide the correct credential for your client class, you do not need to call these methods directly. Authenticating clients will be discussed further in the [examples](#writing-management-plane-test) section.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Important: `mgmt_settings_real.py` should not be committed since it contains your actual credentials!\\n\\nfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential\\r\\n    return DefaultAzureCredential()\\r\\n```\\r\\nThese two methods are used by the authentication methods within `AzureTestCase` to provide the correct credential for your client class, you do not need to call these methods directly. Authenticating clients will be discussed further in the [examples](#writing-management-plane-test) section.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Important: `mgmt_settings_real.py` should not be committed since it contains your actual credentials! To prevent this, it is included in `.gitignore`.**\\n\\n## Running tests in live mode\\n\\nTo configure the tests to run in live mode, you have two options:\\r\\n* Set the environment variable `AZURE_TEST_RUN_LIVE` to \\\"true\\\" or \\\"yes\\\".\\r\\n* Create the `eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools/devtools_testutils/testsettings_local.cfg` file and copy and paste the following line:\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n    live-mode: true\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n(`testsettings_local.cfg` is listed in `.gitignore` and not present in the repo; if it's missing, the tests default to playback mode.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can run tests using the same method described in [Running the tests](#running-the-tests). You would be well-advised to specify a limited number of tests to run. Running every existing test in live mode will take a very long time and produce a great deal of changes to recording files in your Git repository. However, for changes in the client code, the recordings will need to be committed to the Git repository.\\n\\n## Running tests in playback mode\\n\\nNow that the tests have been run against live resources and generated the HTTP recordings, you can run your tests in playback mode. There are two options for changing from live mode to playback mode:\\r\\n* Set the environment variable `AZURE_TEST_RUN_LIVE` to \\\"false\\\" or \\\"no\\\".\\r\\n* Change the `eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools/devtools_testutils/testsettings_local.cfg` file to:\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n    live-mode: false\\r\\n    ```\\n\\n# Writing new tests\\n\\nCode in the [`azure-sdk-tools/devtools_testutils`][devtools_testutils] directory provides concrete implementations of the features provided in `scenario_tests` that are oriented around use in SDK testing and that you can use directly in your unit tests.\\n\\n## Test structure\\n\\nNew tests should be located alongside the packages containing the code they test. For example, the tests for `azure-mgmt-media` are in `azure-mgmt-media/tests`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also legacy tests in the following three locations:\\r\\n\\r\\n*   azure-servicebus/tests\\r\\n*   azure-servicemanagement-legacy/tests\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information about legacy tests, see [Legacy tests](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Legacy-tests).\\n\\n## Writing management plane test\\n\\nManagement plane SDKs are those that are formatted `azure-mgmt-xxxx`, otherwise the SDK is data plane. Management plane SDKs work against the [Azure Resource Manager APIs][arm_apis], while the data plane SDKs will work against service APIs. This section will demonstrate writing tests using `devtools_testutils` with a few increasingly sophisticated examples to show how to use some of the features of the underlying test frameworks.\\n\\n### Tips:\\n\\nAfter the migration of the test proxy, `conftests.py` needs to be configured under the tests folder.\\u003cbr/\\u003e\\r\\n* For a sample about `conftest.py`, see [conftest.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk\"},{\"document_source\":\"azure-sdk-guidelines\",\"document_filename\":\"general_design.html\",\"document_title\":\"General Guidelines: API Design\",\"document_link\":\"https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_design.html\",\"content\":\"# general_design.html\\n\\n# General Guidelines: API Design\\n\\nThe API surface of your client library must have the most thought as it is the primary interaction that the consumer has with your service.\\n\\n## Namespaces\\n\\nexample, \\\"Azure Media Analytics\\\" would have a compressed service name of `MediaAnalytics`, whereas \\\"Azure Service Bus\\\" would become `ServiceBus`.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-namespaces-approved-list\\\" %} use the following list as the group of services (if the target language supports namespaces):\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include tables/data_namespaces.md %}\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the client library does not seem to fit into the group list, contact the [Architecture Board] to discuss the namespace requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-namespaces-mgmt\\\" %} place the management (Azure Resource Manager) API in the `management` group.  Use the grouping `\\u003cAZURE\\u003e.management.\\u003cgroup\\u003e.\\u003cservice\\u003e` for the namespace. Since more services require control plane APIs than data plane APIs, other namespaces may be used explicitly for control plane only.  Data plane usage is by exception only.  Additional namespaces that can be used for control plane SDKs include:\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include tables/mgmt_namespaces.md %}\\r\\n\\r\\nMany `management` APIs do not have a data plane because they deal with management of the Azure account. Place the management library in the `\\u003cAZURE\\u003e.management` namespace.  For example, use `azure.management.costanalysis` instead of `azure.management.management.costanalysis`.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id=\\\"general-namespaces-similar-names\\\" %} choose similar names for clients that do different things.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-namespaces-registration\\\" %} register the chosen namespace with the [Architecture Board].  Open an issue to request the namespace.  See [the registered namespace list](registered_namespaces.html) for a list of the currently registered namespaces.\\n\\nSome languages have a concept of namespaces to group related types.  Grouping services within a cloud infrastructure is common since it aids discoverability and provides structure to the reference documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/SHOULD id=\\\"general-namespaces-support\\\" %} support namespaces if namespace usage is common within the language ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-namespaces-naming\\\" %} use a root namespace of the form `\\u003cAZURE\\u003e.\\u003cgroup\\u003e.\\u003cservice\\u003e`.  All consumer-facing APIs that are commonly used should exist within this namespace.  The namespace is comprised of three parts:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `\\u003cAZURE\\u003e` indicates a common prefix for all Azure services.  This may be `Azure` or `com.azure` or similiar, depending on the common form within the language.\\r\\n- `\\u003cgroup\\u003e` is the group for the service.  See the list below.\\r\\n- `\\u003cservice\\u003e` is the shortened service name.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-namespaces-shortened-name\\\" %} pick a shortened service name that allows the consumer to tie the package to the service being used.  As a default, use the compressed service name.  The namespace does **NOT** change when the branding of the product changes, so avoid the use of marketing names that may change.\\r\\n\\r\\nA compressed service name is the service name without spaces.  It may further be shortened if the shortened version is well known in the community.  For example, \\\"Azure Media Analytics\\\" would have a compressed service name of `MediaAnalytics`, whereas \\\"Azure Service Bus\\\" would become `ServiceBus`.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-namespaces-approved-list\\\" %} use the following list as the group of services (if the target language supports namespaces):\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include tables/data_namespaces.md %}\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the client library does not seem to fit into the group list, contact the [Architecture Board] to discuss the namespace requirements.\\n\\n### Example Namespaces\\n\\nHere are some examples of namespaces that meet these guidelines:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `Azure.Data.Cosmos`\\r\\n- `Azure.Identity.ActiveDirectory`\\r\\n- `Azure.IoT.DeviceProvisioning`\\r\\n- `Azure.Storage.Blobs`\\r\\n- `Azure.Messaging.NotificationHubs` (the client library for Notification Hubs)\\r\\n- `Azure.Management.Messaging.NotificationHubs` (the management library for Notification Hubs)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some namespaces that do not meet the guidelines:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB` (not in the `Azure` namespace and does not use grouping)\\r\\n- `Azure.MixedReality.Kinect` (the grouping is not in the approved list)\\r\\n- `Azure.IoT.IoTHub.DeviceProvisioning` (too many levels in the group)\\n\\n## Client interface\\n\\nThe API surface will consist of one of more _service clients_ that the consumer will instantiate to connect to your service, plus a set of supporting types.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of service clients in a client library should be minimized to provide consumers a clear starting point for using the library. However, multiple service clients may be appropriate in the following situations:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The service supports two distinct use cases, such as \\\"authoring\\\" and \\\"inference\\\", or \\\"administration\\\" and \\\"runtime\\\", that are unlikely to be used together.\\r\\n- The service has a small subset of methods that are needed for its hero scenarios.\\r\\n- A subset of service requests require special/different permissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a client library has multiple service clients, these must have descriptive names so that the consumer can quickly determine which client to use to accomplish their task.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-client-naming\\\" %} name service client types with the `client` suffix.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are times when operations require the addition of optional data, provided in what is colloquially known as an \\\"options bag\\\".

They cannot do this if the same operation is referred to by different verbs in different languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are standard verb prefixes.  You should have a good (articulated) reason to have an alternate verb for one of these operations.  For example, .NET uses `Get\\u003cnoun\\u003es` instead of `List\\u003cnoun\\u003es` since it is idiomatic to the language.\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include tables/standard_verbs.md %}\\r\\n\\r\\n{% include requirement/MUST id=\\\"general-client-feature-support\\\" %} support 100% of the features provided by the Azure service the client library represents.

For instance, many version strings are based on SemVer, which allows dots and dashes.  However, these characters are not allowed in identifiers.  The developer **MUST** be able to clearly understand what service API version will be used when the service version is set to each value in the `ServiceVersion` enumerated value.\\n\\nThe purposes of the client library is to communicate with an Azure service.

Often, these are subtle design decisions that seem benign at the time, but end up introducing significant downstream friction for developers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne common area of friction for developers is _polymorphism_ -- where a value may have any of several types or structures.\\r\\nPolymorphism can be beneficial in certain cases, e.g. as a way to express inheritance, but also creates friction because it requires the value to be introspected before being processed and cannot be represented in a natural/useful way in many nominally typed languages. The use of a discriminator field (`kind`) simplifies the introspection, but developers frequently end up having to explicitly cast the response to the appropriate type in order to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections are another common area of friction for developers.

This is a standard pattern for ARM resource providers and is required by the ARM RPC contract for collection/list operations.\\\\n\\\\nTo ensure SDKs expose these query parameters:\\\\n- In your API specification (ideally using TypeSpec), define these query parameters on your list operations using the appropriate decorators and traits.\\\\n- For TypeSpec, Azure provides standard models and traits for OData query parameters (like `FilterQueryParameter`, `OrderByQueryParameter`, and `StandardListQueryParameters`) in the `Azure.Core` library. These can be composed into list operations via traits, so SDK generators will surface them as arguments in the generated SDK methods.\\\\n- When you use these traits, the generated SDK methods for list operations will include parameters for `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, etc. This enables consumers to pass these values in SDK calls, and they will be sent as query parameters in the HTTP requests.\\\\n\\\\nExample TypeSpec usage:\\\\n```typespec\\\\nimport \\\\\\\"@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core\\\\\\\";\\\\nusing Azure.Core;\\\\nusing Azure.Core.Traits;\\\\n\\\\nop listWidgets is Azure.Core.ResourceList<\\\\n  Widget,\\\\n  ListQueryParametersTrait<StandardListQueryParameters & FilterQueryParameter & OrderByQueryParameter>\\\\n>;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will generate SDK methods with arguments for filtering, sorting, and pagination, matching the REST API behavior.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:** As long as your API spec declares the OData query parameters on the list operation, the SDKs generated for Azure ARM will expose them as method arguments. No special SDK logic is needed beyond this; the SDKs will pass these parameters through to the REST API endpoints. If you use TypeSpec, leverage the standard Azure traits and models to ensure consistent and compliant exposure of these parameters.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"ARM SDKs do support OData\\\\u2011style query parameters (such as filter, orderby, search, top, skip, select, and expand), but only if your API spec explicitly defines them using TypeSpec or OpenAPI models like Azure.Core.FilterQueryParameter and OrderByQueryParameter. The SDKs don\\\\u2019t add these automatically or treat them specially\\\\u2014they simply expose whatever query parameters your spec declares, following Azure API Guidelines (camelCase names, not $filter). Both C# and Python treat these as normal query parameters, and paging behaviors reinject parameters as needed. In short: define the parameters in your spec, and the SDKs will fully support them.\\\\nhere is an example of the paging pattern in C#\\\\n```\\\\n// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

            "inputs.response": "To resolve the issue where the .NET SDK was not generated during the Azure SDK release process, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Release Prerequisites**: Ensure all the prerequisites are completed before starting the SDK release pipeline. This includes:\n   - REST API specs must be merged into the main branch of the public Azure REST API specs repo.\n   - SDK generation must be completed, and an SDK pull request should be created in the Azure SDK repository.\n   - The release plan should be created and followed.\n\n2. **.NET Management Plane SDK Generation**: For .NET, SDK generation is not automated with the release pipeline for OpenAPI specs. You must generate the SDK manually:\n   - Use the instructions in the [Generate .NET management plane SDK](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/develop/sdk-generate-mgmt-dotnet) guide.\n   - Run the required `dotnet build /t:GenerateCode` commands locally to generate the SDK code.\n   - Ensure your `autorest.md` is correctly configured to point to the main branch of the REST API specs.\n   - Build and test the SDK locally.\n\n3. **Push and PR**: Once generated, push your changes to a branch in your fork and create a pull request against the `main` branch of [Azure/azure-sdk-for-net](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net).\n\n4. **Monitor PR and Address Issues**: Monitor the PR for any CI/build failures. If the build fails, review error logs and address any compatibility or configuration issues.\n   - If generation errors occur, file an issue in the [Azure/azure-sdk-for-net GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net) for support.\n\n5. **Get Help**: If the engineering system itself (e.g., pipelines, tooling) is broken, reach out to the Azure SDK Engineering System team via the [Engineering System Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a59dbfadafb5e41c4890e2cd3d74cc7ba%40thread.skype/Engineering%2520System%2520%25F0%259F%259B%25A0%25EF%25B8%258F?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) or via email (azuresdkengsysteam@microsoft.com).\n\n**Summary:**\n- .NET SDK generation is not automated for OpenAPI specs during the release pipeline; manual generation is required.\n- Ensure all prerequisites are met, generate locally, push, and create PR.\n- Address any build/test failures.\n- Use official support channels for engineering system issues.\n\nIf you need more details or specific error logs to diagnose, please provide the exact error messages or context from the failed generation/build.",

Further information is available at [Azure SDK for .NET – naming conventions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/doc/dev/Mgmt-Naming-Conventions.md). Guidelines for additional languages are available at the [Azure SDKs site](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo customize the SDK as needed, you need to configure `client.tsp`.

This is particularly interesting\\r\\nfor common infrastructure changes that are committed in the repo (i.e. github actions, tools, etc). Depending on how old your\\r\\nbranch is some of the pull request checks may not correctly function without taking a merge from main. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are working in a non-protected branch you can do a `git merge main` like you would normally do a merge and then push\\r\\nyour changes to your remote branch. However, if you are working in a branch with branch protection enabled (i.e. `release-*`) then\\r\\nyou will need to make a pull request to your branch with the merge. Depending on how out-of-date your branch is from `main` your \\r\\nmerge may have a lot of unwanted and unnecessary changes and the checks not pass. In such cases see below on how to [update the infrastructure](#updating-only-the-infrastructure-changes-from-main).\\n\\n### Updating only the infrastructure changes from main\\n\\nIn cases you need to only update the infrastructure code and not the specifications we have a helper pipeline \\r\\nwhich you can run that will create a pull request with a selective merge. The selective merge will include everything except for specs \\r\\nunder the specifications folder. This will enable you to only update the infrastructure and not other specs which should get your checks \\r\\npassing in your protected branch. Follow these steps to run the helper pipeline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e This should only be needed for protected branches, such as `release-*`. If you are in an unprotected branch, just use a normal `git merge main`.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Go to [tools - update-release-branch-in-specs](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7487) and select **Run Pipeline**.\\r\\nIf you don't have permission see [GitHub account linked with your Microsoft account](xref:access).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Enter the name of your branch in the **BranchToMergeTo** parameter. Usually this will be in the form `release-\\u003cname\\u003e`.  You shouldn't need to set \\r\\nthe other parameters but if your branch is in the private repo then you will need to update **Repo** to be `Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr`.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Click the **Run** button.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The pipeline should only take a few minutes to run and once it is complete then go find the pull request it created. You can find a link to it in the \\r\\npipeline logs under the **Create Pull Request to merge** step. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Monitor the created pull request and approve it. Once the checks are green then merge the pull request and then your branch should be updated with the latest infrastructure changes.\\r\\nIf you have open PRs against your branch with failing checks, go to those PRs and retrigger the checks. The easiest way to retrigger all checks\\r\\nis to hit the close button followed by the open button, which should cause the checks to re-run.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\n1.

A `deprecated` API spec version need to be removed from the spec repository, with removal initiated by the service to begin deprecating related APIs, SDKs, and CLIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese stages corresponds to [service tree lifecycle stages] as elaborated on in [ARM lifecycle stages requirements].\\n\\n### Generally available\\n\\n**GA** API versions have been released to all Azure customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an API version to be in GA it must:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Be present in the `main` branch of the [public specs repo].\\r\\n- Be in a parent `stable` folder and without a `-preview` suffix. See [spec directory structure] for full details.\\r\\n- Not be gated by any feature flags, including Azure Feature Exposure Control ([AFEC]) flags.\\n\\n### Public preview\\n\\n**Public preview** API versions have been released to all Azure customers, but are not yet GA.\\r\\nFor an API version to be in `public preview`, it must:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Not yet be GA.\\r\\n- Be present in the `main` branch of the [public specs repo].\\r\\n- Be in a parent `preview` folder and have `-preview` suffix in its folder name.\\r\\n  See [spec directory structure] and [ARM preview guidelines] for full details.\\r\\n- Not be gated by any feature flags, including [AFEC] flags.\\n\\n### Private preview\\n\\n**Private preview** API versions have been released to a limited set of Azure customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually API versions are in `private preview` for following reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The spec API version preview cannot yet be made public due to business or marketing reasons.\\r\\n- Early customer feedback is being gathered for given API version preview.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an API version to be in `private preview`, it must:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Not yet be `GA` or in `public preview`.\\r\\n- Not be present in the [public specs repo] `main` branch or any other branch in that repo.\\r\\n- Be in a parent `preview` folder and have `-prefix` in its folder name.\\r\\n  See [spec directory structure] and [ARM preview guidelines] for full details.\\r\\n- Have at least one customer. If an API version has no customers, it is `in development`, not in `private preview`.\\r\\n- In case of ARM specs:\\r\\n  - Be present in the `RPSaaSMaster` branch of the [private specs repo].\\r\\n    See [ARM branches] and [ARM lifecycle stages requirements] for details.\\r\\n  - Be under access control done with [AFEC] flags.\\r\\n- In case of data-plane specs:\\r\\n  - Can be in any branch in the [private specs repo], except `main` or `RPaaS*` branches,\\r\\n    as there is no designated branch like `RPSaaSMaster` for ARM specs.\\r\\n  - There is no need for access control done with [AFEC] flags, as data plane services should have some mechanism\\r\\n    for allowing `private preview` customers to onboard the preview.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e A `private preview` API spec version can be published as `public preview` by following  \\r\\n\\u003e [this how-to](xref:pr-move-private-to-public).\\n\\n### In development\\n\\n**In development** API versions are all API versions that are not `GA`, in `public preview` or in `private preview`.\\r\\nNotably, such API versions are not present in the [public specs repo] `main` branch and do not have any customers.\\r\\nHowever, they may be present in the public repo feature branches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!IMPORTANT]\\r\\n\\u003e REST API definitions for a service or API version that is `in development` MUST NOT be present in the  \\r\\n\\u003e [public specs repo] `main` at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!NOTE]\\r\\n\\u003e ARM spec API version, while `in development`, should not be trying to merge into `RPSaaSMaster`.\\r\\n\\u003e The ARM guidance for this is in [ARM spec onboarding] article.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Special cases** There are few special situations that do not fit in the API versioning model described above.\\r\\nIn such situations, attend appropriate office hours:\\r\\n\\r\\n- In case of ARM specs, **ARM API Review Office Hours** in [aka.ms/armofficehoursinfo].\\r\\n- In case of data-plane specs, [aka.ms/azapi/officehours].\\n\\n## Spec repos branches\\n\\n### Public specs repo `main` branch\\n\\nAll API versions in the [public specs repo] `main` branch are published to all Azure customers.\\r\\nThis branch includes `GA` and `public preview` API versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003e [!CAUTION]\\r\\n\\u003e This is not a dev branch.

Generate SDK code from a TypeSpec project\\n\\n### 1. Introduction\\n\\nThis document describes the processes of developing Azure REST APIs and SDKs with TypeSpec language. The steps below\\r\\n assumes that you are developing TypeSpec API specifications in the `azure-rest-api-specs` and `azure-rest-api-specs-pr`repos.\\r\\nIf you are developing within your own ADO repo first and then submitting into `azure-rest-api-specs` repos for review and\\r\\n release, you will need to copy the TypeSpec files over.\\n\\n### 2. Repo setup \\u0026 prerequisites\\n\\n- The main repos for Azure REST APIs are [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs) and [azure-rest-api-specs-pr](https://github.com/azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr)\\r\\n repos. The `-pr` repo contains `RPSaaSMaster` and `RPSaaSDev` branches for ProviderHub based ARM service specs.\\r\\n#### 2.1 With local machine development\\r\\n- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18 or above (LTS Recommended).\\r\\n Ensure you can run the npm command in a command prompt:\\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n    npm --version\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- Run following command in the **repository root folder**. This will install required packages such as TypeSpec\\r\\n compilers and Azure Library packages.\\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n     npm ci\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- Ensure you can run TypeSpec command within the repo folders.\\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n     npx tsp --version\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- One-time set up: Install TypeSpec VisualStudio or VS Code extensions to get syntex highlighting, tool tips in IDE:  \\r\\n  ```npm\\r\\n    npx tsp code install\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  OR\\r\\n    ```npm\\r\\n      npx tsp vs install\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n#### 2.2  VS Code with local docker .devcontainer\\r\\nAll prerequisites have been installed in the dev container. You should to have `Docker Desktop` and `WSL2` running if\\r\\n you are on Windows machine.\\r\\nTo start, you just need to install `Dev Containers` VS code extension, then open the repo path.\\r\\n- VS Code will detect the .devcontainer and prompt you to reopen the workspace.\\r\\n- Alternatively, you can use Command Palette -\\u003e Dev Containers: Reopen in Container.  \\r\\nOnce VS Code reopened in Container, you can run any of the program below in the VS Code integrated terminal.\\r\\n#### 2.2 VS Code in browser via GitHub codespaces\\r\\nGitHub codespaces leverage the same dev container in the repo. The difference is it is hosted in cloud with VS Code in\\r\\n browser.\\r\\nTo start, you just need to browse to the `azure-rest-api-specs` repo, select `\\u003c\\u003e Code` drop down and follow `Codespaces`\\r\\n instructions.\\n\\n### 3. Creating a new TypeSpec project\\n\\nPlease first review recommended folder structure detailed in [this document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/directory-structure.md).\\r\\n1. Under `[reporoot]\\\\specification`, create service folder directly.\\r\\n   - Select `(rest-api-spec repo) ARM` or `(rest-api-spec repo) Data-plane` and answer appropriate naming questions.\\r\\n   - If it's ARM service, the service folder would be `specification/{organization}/resource-manager/\\u003cRPNS\\u003e/{service}`.\\r\\n   - If it's Data Plane service, the service folder would be `specification/{organization}/data-plane/{service}`\\r\\n2. Create a new TypeSpec project based on Azure template with command:\\r\\n    ```cli\\r\\n       npx tsp init https://aka.ms/typespec/azure-init\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n3. Compile the generated TypeSpec project with command:\\r\\n    ```cli\\r\\n      npx tsp compile .\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n    The generated OpenAPI files should be correctly placed in the `{service}`folders following the naming conventions.\\r\\n4. Now the project has been set up. You can modify the sample and develop your own APIs with TypeSpec.\\n\\n### 4. Prepare and submit a Pull Request for reviewing\\n\\n1. Create a branch in your local repository for your changes.\\r\\n2. Create or update the TypeSpec files for your service.\\r\\n3. Add or update 'examples' files for each operation of your OpenAPI file.\\r\\n   The [oav](https://github.com/Azure/oav) provides two ways to generate OpenAPI examples:\\r\\n   1. Generating basic examples and then manually modify the values. It will generate two examples for each operation:\\r\\n    one contains minimal properties set, the other contains the maximal properties set. Since the auto-generated\\r\\n     examples consist of random values for most types, you need replace them with meaningful values.\\r\\n       ```bash\\r\\n       oav generate-examples openapi.json\\r\\n       ```\\r\\n    Note, latest OAV tool should automatically generate the following. However, if you are generating the examples manually,\\r\\n     please ensure you have:\\r\\n    - include `title` field and make sure it is descriptive and unique for each operation.\\r\\n    - include `operationId`. This is used to match with declared operations in TypeSpec and correctly output in OpenAPI.\\r\\n4. Add/update the `readme.md` file in the `{service}` folder to specify the version and location of the OpenAPI files. The `readme.md` is needed for both management-plane and data-plane services for REST API Docs generation.\\r\\n   Example:[sample-readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/widget/resource-manager/Microsoft.Widget/Widget/readme.md)\\r\\n5. Generate OpenAPI files:\\r\\n   - sync with the target branch in the azure-rest-api-specs repo\\r\\n      ```git\\r\\n       git pull upstream \\u003ctarget-branch\\u003e\\r\\n      ```\\r\\n   - in the root directory, run `npm install`\\r\\n   - in the project directory, `npx tsp compile`. This will generate OpenAPI files under `{service}` folders.\\r\\n6. Ensure all generated files under `{service}` have been added to PR.\\r\\n7. Send a pull request .\\r\\n   - commit all your changes.\\r\\n   - push your branch to your fork of the repo.\\n\\n5. Generate OpenAPI files:\\r\\n   - sync with the target branch in the azure-rest-api-specs repo\\r\\n      ```git\\r\\n       git pull upstream \\u003ctarget-branch\\u003e\\r\\n      ```\\r\\n   - in the root directory, run `npm install`\\r\\n   - in the project directory, `npx tsp compile`.

Instead, you should:\n\n- Add the proposed language-specific dependencies (e.g., System.Security.Cryptography.Cose for .NET, and the respective CBOR/COSE libraries for other languages) to your SDK implementation.\n- Prepare to discuss these dependencies during your SDK review meeting with the Azure SDK Architecture Board (for data plane libraries), or as part of the namespace review (for management plane libraries).\n- The review will cover package names, API surface, hero scenarios, and also the appropriateness of dependencies for each language. The architects will provide feedback and approval as part of the standard review workflow.\n\nThere is no mention of a centralized approval workflow or pre-approved dependency list in the onboarding or review documentation. All dependencies are subject to review and approval during the regular SDK review process for each language. Ensure that your proposed dependencies meet Azure SDK guidelines and language-specific best practices before presenting them for review.\n\nIf you require further clarification or have concerns about a specific dependency, you can contact the Azure SDK Architecture Board directly at azsdkarch-help@microsoft.com, or bring it up during your scheduled SDK review meeting.\n",

There is no indication in the current documentation of a centralized or global approval policy for such dependencies across all Azure SDKs. Instead, you should:\\\\n\\\\n- Add the proposed language-specific dependencies (e.g., System.Security.Cryptography.Cose for .NET, and the respective CBOR/COSE libraries for other languages) to your SDK implementation.\\\\n- Prepare to discuss these dependencies during your SDK review meeting with the Azure SDK Architecture Board (for data plane libraries), or as part of the namespace review (for management plane libraries).\\\\n- The review will cover package names, API surface, hero scenarios, and also the appropriateness of dependencies for each language. The architects will provide feedback and approval as part of the standard review workflow.\\\\n\\\\nThere is no mention of a centralized approval workflow or pre-approved dependency list in the onboarding or review documentation. All dependencies are subject to review and approval during the regular SDK review process for each language. Ensure that your proposed dependencies meet Azure SDK guidelines and language-specific best practices before presenting them for review.\\\\n\\\\nIf you require further clarification or have concerns about a specific dependency, you can contact the Azure SDK Architecture Board directly at azsdkarch-help@microsoft.com, or bring it up during your scheduled SDK review meeting.\\\\n\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"I would suggest an email to azsdkarch@microsoft.com to discuss this.\\\"}\"}]",
