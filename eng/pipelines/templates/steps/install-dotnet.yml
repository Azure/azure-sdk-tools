  # We install .NET 6.0.x SDK in addition to .NET coming from global.json because most of our tools target 6.0.x.

      # We must install sdk, not just runtime, as it is required by some of our tools, like test-proxy.
      # Specifically, test-proxy requires asp.net core runtime, which is installed only when sdk option
      # is selected, per: https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/14405
