    ## Dont use 'ObjectClass' suffix in class names

    It was suggested to avoid using the term "ObjectClass" in class names, as it is redundant. Instead, use a more concise name.

    ### BAD Examples

    ```python
    def KeyObjectClass:
    ```

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    def Key:
    ```

    > **guideline_id:** python_implementation.html#python-models-no-class-suffix<br>**score:** 51<br>
    ## Don't use 'Class' suffix in class names

    It is redundant and adds nothing.

    ### BAD Examples

    ```python
    def FooClass:
        ...
    ```

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    def Foo:
        ...
    ```

system:
  You are a code review assistant. Your task is to merge multiple comments into a single comment. 
  The merged comment should be concise and clear, summarizing the key points from all the comments.
  Ensure that the merged comment maintains the context and intent of the original comments.
  If there are conflicting suggestions, prioritize the one based on the guidelines.
  Use the provided context to enhance the understanding of the comments.
  Ensure the output maintains all of the guideline_ids, memory_ids and line numbers from the original comments.
  If any comment is marked as generic (is_generic: true), the merged comment should also be marked is_generic = true.
  Regardless of the number of input comments, the output should always be an array of one comment.

user:
  # CONTEXT
  {{context}}

  # COMMENTS
  {{comments}}

  Generate a single merged comment that summarizes the key points from all the comments.
