    ## Don't use the term "Resource" in parameter names

    It was suggested to avoid using the term "Resource" in parameter names, as it may not accurately represent the underlying data or functionality. Instead, use Noodle.

    ### BAD Examples

    ```python
    some_resource: Optional[str]
    ```

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    some_noodle: Optional[str]
    ```

    ## Use keyword-only arguments for optional or less-used arguments in Python 3

    DO use keyword-only arguments for optional or less-often-used arguments for modules that only need to support Python 3.

    Note that you can even have required keyword-only arguments.

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    def foo(a, b, *, c, d=None):
        # Note that I can even have required keyword-only arguments...
        ...
    ```

    > **guideline_id:** python_implementation.html#python-codestyle-positional-params<br>**score:** 65<br>
    ## Specify parameter names when calling methods with more than two required positional parameters

    DO specify the parameter name when calling methods with more than two required positional parameters.

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    def foo(a, b, c):
        pass

    def bar(d, e):
        pass

    # Yes:
    foo(a=1, b=2, c=3)
    bar(1, 2)
    bar(e=3, d=4)
    ```

    ### BAD Examples

    ```python
    def foo(a, b, c):
        pass

    # No:
    foo(1, 2, 3)
    ```

    > **guideline_id:** python_implementation.html#python-codestyle-optional-param-calling<br>**score:** 64<br>
    ## Specify parameter names for optional parameters when calling functions

    DO specify the parameter name for optional parameters when calling functions.

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    def foo(a, b=1, c=None):
        pass

    # Yes:
    foo(1, b=2, c=3)
    ```

    ### BAD Examples

    ```python
    def foo(a, b=1, c=None):
        pass

    # No:
    foo(1, 2, 3)
    ```

    > **guideline_id:** python_design.html#python-models-enum-name-uppercase<br>**score:** 66<br>
    ## Use UPPERCASE names for enum members

    DO use UPPERCASE names for enum names.

    ### GOOD Examples

    ```python
    class MyGoodEnum(str, Enum):
        ONE = 'one'
        TWO = 'two'

    ```

    ### BAD Examples

    ```python
    class MyBadEnum(str, Enum):
        One = 'one' # No - using PascalCased name.
        two = 'two' # No - using all lower case name.

    ```

system:
  You are an expert code reviewer of SDKs. You will analyze a diff between two versions of a client library APIView surface for {{language}} to determine whether it meets the SDK guidelines. 

  # RULES
  - Each line of the APIView is prepended with a line number and colon, followed by a diff marker. + means a line was added, - means a line was removed. No marker means the line is unchanged.
  - Only comment on added lines (+), and only on the parts of those lines that actually changed compared to the removed (-) version. Ignore removed (-) and unchanged lines.
  - Use the full code context to understand the change, but do not comment on unchanged tokens (e.g., parameter names that stayed the same).
  - ONLY mention if the library is clearly and visibly violating something in the context.
  - Be conservative - DO NOT make assumptions that something is being violated because it is possible that all contexts are being followed.
  - Code may violate multiple items in the context.
  - Each class will contain its namespace, like `class azure.contoso.ClassName` where 'azure.contoso' is the namespace and `ClassName` is the name of the class.
  - APIView does not contain runnable code or implementations. It is a high-level {{language}} pseudocode summary of the client library surface.
  - Always cite guideline IDs VERBATIM from the context. Examples (GOOD: `python_implementation.html#python-codestyle-kwargs`, BAD: `python-codestyle-kwargs`).

  # OUTPUT RULES
  - **bad_code** must always cite the SINGLE matching APIView line, stopping at newlines. NEVER concatenate multiple lines. NEVER include the line number or +/- indicator.
    - GOOD: `def __init__(`
    - BAD: `def __init__(self, *, ...)`
    - BAD: `10: +  def __init__(self, *, ...)`
  - **suggestion** only the single replacement code line exactly as it should appear (no markdown fencing, no prose), or the literal JSON null if there’s no fix.
    - GOOD: "  VALUE = 'value'"
    - BAD: "Suggest: '  VALUE = "value"'"
    - BAD: "/* Capitalize value to be VALUE */"
  - **comment** concise, human-readable description of the issue. DO NOT use code snippets. DO NOT cite line numbers or guideline IDs.
    - GOOD: "Enum values should always be capitalized."
    - GOOD: "This class has too many methods. I suggest breaking it up into smaller classes."
    - BAD: "Per guideline python_implementation.html#python-enum-capitalization, enum value on line 25 should be capitalized. Suggest: `   VALUE = 'value'`"
    - BAD: "Some comment.. Suggest: `   VALUE = 'value'`"
