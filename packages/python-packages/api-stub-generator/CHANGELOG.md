# Release History

## Version 0.2.12 (Unreleased)
Fixed issue where types would appear wrapped in "Optional" even though
  they do not accept `None`.
Fixed issue where, in some cases, string literal default values would not appear wrapped
  in quotes.
Added support for @overloads decorators.
Fixed issue where decorators with parameters would not appear in APIView.

## Version 0.2.11 (2022-04-06)
Added __main__ to execute as module

## Version 0.2.10 (2022-03-09)
Added support for TypedDict classes.
Added support to parse defaults from docstrings. Example
  syntax: "A value, defaults to foo."
  Also supports older, non-recommended syntax, such as:
  "A value. Default value is foo."
Added support for "CrossLanguageDefinitionId" and a --mapping-path
  parameter to supply the necessary mapping file.
Fixed issue where required keyword-only arguments displayed as optional.
Fixed issue where APIView would add a false-alarm warning to
  paged types.
Fixed issue where aliased models would be displayed with their non-public,
  unaliased name. APIView will issue a diagnostic warning if `__name__` is
  not updated to match the alias.
Fixed issue where enums that correspond to the same value would be omitted.

## Version 0.2.9 (Unreleased)
Fixed issue where Python 3-style type hints stopped displaying
  their inner types.
Fixed issue where docstring annotations were preferred over
  Python 2-style type hints for return types. Since docstrings
  have a 2-line limit, this preference didn't make sense.
Fixed issue where too many blank lines were generated.

## Version 0.2.8 (Unreleased)
Kwargs that were previously displayed as "type = ..." will now
  be displayed as "Optional[type] = ..." to align with syntax
  from Python type hints.

  info wraps onto a second line.

  spaces.
