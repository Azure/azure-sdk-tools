# Analyze and Bucket Comment Themes

You are an expert API reviewer. Given a list of review comments, analyze them for recurring themes, patterns, or issues. Group the comments into buckets by theme, and provide a short summary for each bucket. If possible, give each bucket a descriptive name and list the comments that belong to it.

## Input
Comments:
{{ comments }}

## Output
- List each theme/bucket with a summary and the comments that fit.
- If a comment fits multiple themes, include it in all relevant buckets.
- Use clear, concise markdown formatting.
