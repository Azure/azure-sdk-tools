  action: update_kb
  reasoning: |
    The architect indicates that while the copilot's comment about verbosity was correct, the suggestion itself was flawed and more verbose than needed.
    This suggests the copilot's suggestion logic needs improvement and should be recorded in the Knowledge Base.
