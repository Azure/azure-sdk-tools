# Rust API Parser

This repository contains tools for cleaning and parsing  rustdoc output into API view. 
It includes two main folders: `clean-rust-doc-output` and `get-api-view`.

## clean-rust-doc-output

This tool reads the JSON output generated by `rustdoc` and strips off unneeded items/metadata from the rustdoc generated JSON output w.r.t the APIView tool. Generates a scoped down version of the rustdoc output.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, you can install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Navigate to the `clean-rust-doc-output` folder.
3. Run the tool using:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## get-api-view

This TypeScript tool processes the cleaned JSON output from `clean-rust-doc-output` and generates a JSON document representing the API view. It organizes the API elements into modules, functions, and other Rust constructs.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Navigate to the `get-api-view` folder.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm install -g ts-node typescript
   ```
4. Run the tool using:
   ```sh
   ts-node src/main.ts
   ```
