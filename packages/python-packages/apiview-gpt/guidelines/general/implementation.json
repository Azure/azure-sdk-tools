However, as a client library writer, you must handle the incoming context appropriately.\n\nAzure services should not require customers to use more than HTTP and JSON (where a JSON string is either a \"pure\" string or else parseable/formattable as either an RFC 3339 Date/Time, a UUID, or a Base-64 encoded bytes).  This is in order to minimize the learning curve for customers, increase potential customer reach, as well as reduce support costs for Microsoft (a tenet that the Azure review boards are chartered to oversee and manage).  Azure SDK Languages have already selected libraries to assist with these technologies.\n\nIf a service needs a technology beyond that which has already been selected, the following process can be used:\n\nFirst, the service team can petition the Azure API Stewardship Board to approve technologies that require client-side components.  This must be done early in the design process.  The petitioning team must gather relevant data to justify the critical business need (e.g. competitive advantage, widespread adoption and/or support in the community, improved performance, etc.), why that need cannot reasonably be fulfilled via REST & JSON, the future viability and sustainability of the technology, as well as documentation for the cases/conditions where use of the new technology is indicated.

In this case, the SDK\u2019s documentation must have examples showing a customer how to do this correctly for each SDK language.\n\n\nFirst, the service team can petition the Azure API Stewardship Board to approve technologies that require client-side components.

In this case, the SDK\u2019s documentation must have examples showing a customer how to do this correctly for each SDK language.\n\nThe following are considerations that will be discussed in any petition to include additional technologies:\nVersioning - Many programming languages do not allow a consumer to load multiple versions of the same package. So, if we have an client library that requires v3 of package Foo and the consumer wants to use v5 of package Foo, then the consumer cannot build their application. This means that client libraries should not have dependencies by default.\nSize - Consumer applications must be able to deploy as fast as possible into the cloud and move in various ways across networks. Removing additional code (like dependencies) improves deployment performance.\nLicensing - You must be conscious of the licensing restrictions of a dependency and often provide proper attribution and notices when using them.\nCompatibility - Often times you do not control a dependency and it may choose to evolve in a direction that is incompatible with your original use.\nSecurity - If a security vulnerability is discovered in a dependency, it may be difficult or time consuming to get the vulnerability corrected if Microsoft does not control the dependency's code base."
