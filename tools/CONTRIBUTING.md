# Azure SDK Tools Contribution Guidelines

The tools repository is the collection of all sdk development tool libraries.

## Guidelines

* Every tool library under this folder should work independently for a single purpose.
* Tool under this repo develop for Azure SDK use
* **DO NOT** put any third-party tools under this folder, as we are not responsible for the maintainance of third-party tools

## Development
