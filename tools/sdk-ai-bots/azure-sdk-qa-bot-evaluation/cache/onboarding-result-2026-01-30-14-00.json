            "answer": "To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs and regenerate SDKs, you should follow these steps:\nFix the Spec and Follow Breaking Change Process: If your fix is a breaking change or a bug fix in an already released API version, you must submit a PR against the main branch of the public Azure REST API specs repository. If your PR is labeled with BreakingChangeReviewRequired or VersioningReviewRequired, you must get approval from the Breaking Change Review Board (see aka.ms/brch). For bug fixes, you may be able to apply the BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix label yourself, but the process should be strictly followed.\nARM Review: Once the breaking change review is resolved, request ARM review. Note: You cannot proceed to ARM review until the breaking change process is complete.\nSDK Generation and Release Plan:\nFor TypeSpec-based management plane SDKs (Java, JavaScript, Python, Go):\nUse the release planner to request SDK generation for the fixed API version. This will create a tracking issue in the Azure/sdk-release-request repo.\nThe Shanghai SDK team will generate the SDK and open a PR in the corresponding SDK repository. However, it is the service owner's responsibility to follow up, complete any customizations, and drive the PR through review and merge. You will be notified when the PR is created.\nAfter the SDK is generated, follow the release guidance to publish the package.\nFor .NET: Service owners must generate the SDK manually using the updated TypeSpec, then create and submit a PR to the azure-sdk-for-net repository.\nManual Follow-Up: While the initial SDK PRs for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go are created automatically after you request generation, you are still responsible for any manual updates, review, and merging of these PRs. For .NET, all steps are manual after generation.\nSummary:\nYou do not need to manually create PRs in each SDK repo for Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go; the release planner and SDK generation pipelines will create draft PRs for you after you request generation.\nYou must still review, customize (if needed), and drive the SDK PRs to completion.\nFor .NET, the process is manual: you generate and submit the PR yourself.\nAlways ensure you have breaking change and ARM approvals before requesting SDK generation.\nFor more details, see the referenced documentation below.",

            "answer": "To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs (both preview and stable), the recommended process is as follows:\n\n1. **Branching and Planning**: Create a dedicated release branch for your fix. This ensures changes are isolated from ongoing development. Document your plan in the Release Planner tool, which helps track the steps and approvals required for the fix.\n\n2. **Implement the Fix**: Update the API specification (TypeSpec or OpenAPI) in your branch to correct the invalid type. Ensure the changes are well-documented and justified, especially since this is a breaking change.\n\n3. **Review Process**:\n   - Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes against the release branch.\n   - The PR will be reviewed by the ARM review board (for management plane APIs). For breaking changes, you must also email the Breaking Change Board for approval. This is mandatory for both preview and stable versions.\n\n4. **SDK Regeneration and Updates**:\n   - Once the spec fix is approved and merged, SDKs for all affected languages must be regenerated to reflect the corrected type.\n   - SDK generation pipelines are not automatically triggered by spec merges. You will need to manually initiate SDK generation for each language. This typically involves creating a PR in each SDK repo with the regenerated code based on the updated spec.\n   - For .NET management plane SDKs, follow the documented process to generate the SDK from the updated spec, add tests/samples, and create a PR to the main branch of the public SDK repo.\n   - For other languages, similar manual PRs are required. Automated merging is not supported for breaking changes; each SDK repo must be updated and reviewed individually.\n\n5. **Release and Documentation**:\n   - After SDK PRs are merged, follow the standard release process for each language, including updating CHANGELOGs and ensuring documentation is up to date.\n   - For stable releases, live tests are recommended to verify the fix.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Breaking changes require ARM and Breaking Change Board approval.\n- SDKs must be manually regenerated and updated via PRs in each SDK repo.\n- Use the Release Planner to track and coordinate the process.\n- Automated suppression or merging is not possible for breaking changes; manual review and updates are required.\n\nIf you need further help with the process or tooling, you can reach out to the relevant Teams channels or support emails listed in the documentation.",

I've read through (lightly) the breaking change deep dive, which looks like I'll have to reach out to the review board to get their approval, however, I was wondering what is the recommended way to implement a fix for existing APIs, up to the point where it can be reviewed by ARM and Breaking changes board.\\\\nNormally, I would create a branch, commit a base version for review, then create a release plan against the new branch (then add in changes, get ARM sign off, then request the sdk release).\\\\nHow do I regenerate the SDKs once I have a fix in place for the previously released verisons?  Will they require manual updates (e.g. create a PR in each sdk repo with a fix)?\\\\nAny guidance would be appreciated!\\\", \\\"response\\\": \\\"To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs (both preview and stable), the recommended process is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Branching and Planning**: Create a dedicated release branch for your fix. This ensures changes are isolated from ongoing development. Document your plan in the Release Planner tool, which helps track the steps and approvals required for the fix.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Implement the Fix**: Update the API specification (TypeSpec or OpenAPI) in your branch to correct the invalid type. Ensure the changes are well-documented and justified, especially since this is a breaking change.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Review Process**:\\\\n   - Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes against the release branch.\\\\n   - The PR will be reviewed by the ARM review board (for management plane APIs). For breaking changes, you must also email the Breaking Change Board for approval. This is mandatory for both preview and stable versions.\\\\n\\\\n4. **SDK Regeneration and Updates**:\\\\n   - Once the spec fix is approved and merged, SDKs for all affected languages must be regenerated to reflect the corrected type.\\\\n   - SDK generation pipelines are not automatically triggered by spec merges. You will need to manually initiate SDK generation for each language. This typically involves creating a PR in each SDK repo with the regenerated code based on the updated spec.\\\\n   - For .NET management plane SDKs, follow the documented process to generate the SDK from the updated spec, add tests/samples, and create a PR to the main branch of the public SDK repo.\\\\n   - For other languages, similar manual PRs are required. Automated merging is not supported for breaking changes; each SDK repo must be updated and reviewed individually.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Release and Documentation**:\\\\n   - After SDK PRs are merged, follow the standard release process for each language, including updating CHANGELOGs and ensuring documentation is up to date.\\\\n   - For stable releases, live tests are recommended to verify the fix.\\\\n\\\\n**Summary:**\\\\n- Breaking changes require ARM and Breaking Change Board approval.\\\\n- SDKs must be manually regenerated and updated via PRs in each SDK repo.\\\\n- Use the Release Planner to track and coordinate the process.\\\\n- Automated suppression or merging is not possible for breaking changes; manual review and updates are required.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need further help with the process or tooling, you can reach out to the relevant Teams channels or support emails listed in the documentation.\\\", \\\"ground_truth\\\": \\\"To fix invalid type specifications in previously released APIs and regenerate SDKs, you should follow these steps:\\\\nFix the Spec and Follow Breaking Change Process: If your fix is a breaking change or a bug fix in an already released API version, you must submit a PR against the main branch of the public Azure REST API specs repository. If your PR is labeled with BreakingChangeReviewRequired or VersioningReviewRequired, you must get approval from the Breaking Change Review Board (see aka.ms/brch). For bug fixes, you may be able to apply the BreakingChange-Approved-BugFix label yourself, but the process should be strictly followed.\\\\nARM Review: Once the breaking change review is resolved, request ARM review.

Since you are working on a new preview API version and have generated the SDKs (autogenerated SDK API reviews), here is how you get these reviewed by the specific SDK teams:\nManagement Plane (ARM) SDKs Do NOT Require Arch Board Review:\nFor management plane (ARM) libraries like Azure Fleet, you do NOT need to schedule an SDK Architecture Board meeting. The review process is handled through the pull request (PR) workflow in the Azure REST API Specs repository.\nSDK Review Process for Your Scenario:\nAfter your REST API spec PR is approved and merged, the next steps are:\nEnsure you have a release plan created in the Azure SDK Release Planner.\nThe SDK generation and release planning will involve tracking the release plan milestones, where you can monitor which language SDKs are being generated and when they are ready for review.\nAssigning Specific SDK Teams as Reviewers:\nSDK teams are automatically assigned as reviewers for their respective language repos using the CODEOWNERS file in each SDK repository. If your service is not already listed in the CODEOWNERS file for a given language SDK repo, you should add your service and the appropriate GitHub users or teams to ensure SDK team visibility and review (see the reference for details).\nYou can also @-mention specific SDK team members in the generated SDK PRs in each language repository if you need urgent attention.\nHow to Track and Request Review:\nAfter the SDK PR is generated (either manually or via automation), monitor the PR in the respective SDK repo. The SDK team responsible for that language will review according to the CODEOWNERS assignment.\nIf you do not see timely review or need to escalate, reach out to the language-specific Teams channel or the SDK repo maintainers directly.\nSummary of Steps:\nConfirm your service is listed in the CODEOWNERS file for each SDK repo.\nCreate/track your release plan in the Azure SDK Release Planner.\nMonitor and follow up on the generated SDK PRs for reviews.\nFor Management Plane, no Arch Board meeting is needed; reviews are handled via the PR process.\nLet me know if you need guidance on updating CODEOWNERS or navigating the release planner!\nReferences below provide detailed steps and process links.",

The ground truth describes a process for onboarding and reviewing autogenerated SDK API reviews, with specific steps for management plane SDKs, including the fact that no Architecture Board review is needed, the use of the PR workflow, the need to create and track a release plan, monitoring milestones, and assigning reviewers via CODEOWNERS. It also mentions escalation via Teams channels and repo maintainers, and the option to @-mention for urgent attention.  \\n2. The response covers the use of CODEOWNERS for automatic reviewer assignment, mentions the process is automated, and notes that for management plane services, the review is managed through the SDK Architecture Board and CODEOWNERS. It also mentions escalation via Teams channels or email.  \\n3. The response omits several key points: it does not mention the Azure SDK Release Planner or the need to create/track a release plan, does not clarify that no Architecture Board meeting is needed for management plane SDKs (and actually implies the opposite), does not mention monitoring milestones, and does not mention @-mentioning for urgent attention.  \\n4. The response does cover the CODEOWNERS assignment and escalation channels, but misses about half of the specific steps and contains a significant inaccuracy about the Architecture Board review requirement.  \\n5. Based on the definitions, this matches \\\"Moderately Complete\\\" (Score 3): about half the necessary information is present, but several important steps and a key claim are missing or incorrect.</S0>\\n<S1>The response includes the main mechanism (CODEOWNERS) and escalation channels, but omits or misstates several key steps and requirements, such as the release planner, milestone tracking, and the Arch Board review requirement.</S1>\\n<S2>3</S2>\"}]",

            "answer": "When onboarding new resource types (especially for ARM/Control Plane APIs), the right target branch depends on the stage of your API and whether your work should be public or private:\nIf your resource types are still under development or in private preview (not ready for public visibility), you should target the RPSaaSMaster branch in the private repo: azure-rest-api-specs-pr.\nOnce your API is ready for public preview or GA, you should target the main branch in the public repo: azure-rest-api-specs.\nYou mentioned getting a branch protection error. This is likely because the main branch in the private repo is read-only and mirrored from the public repo. You cannot merge directly into main in the private repo. For private work, use RPSaaSMaster. For public release, use main in the public repo.\nSummary:\nUse azure-rest-api-specs-pr/RPSaaSMaster for private onboarding and early-stage work.\nUse azure-rest-api-specs/main for public onboarding and final publishing.\nIf you need to update your PR, change the target branch to RPSaaSMaster in the private repo for onboarding new resource types. If your resource is ready for public consumption, move it to a PR against the public repo's main branch.\nLet me know if you need help updating your PR or have questions about the process!",
