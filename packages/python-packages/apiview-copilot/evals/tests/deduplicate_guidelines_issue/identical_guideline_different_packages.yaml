  Python naming conventions guideline is outdated
  
  The guideline at https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_design.html#naming-conventions 
  states that class names can use suffixes like "Object", but this is no longer recommended.
  
  **Bad code:**
  ```python
  class StorageClientObject:
  ```
  
  **Should be:**
  ```python
  class StorageClient:
  ```
