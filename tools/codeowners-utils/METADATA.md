# CODEOWNERS Metadata

Azure-sdk* repository CODEOWNERS files contain data beyond the normal source path/owner lines. This metadata is used by workflows for processing. The most notable consumer is [github-event-processor](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/tree/main/tools/github-event-processor) which uses these when processing certain GitHub Actions. The full set of action processing rules is documented [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/github-event-processor/RULES.md). The common definitions used in this document are as follows:

- **Moniker** - Any of the existing tags we currently support. PRLabel or ServiceLabel would be examples of this.
- **Metadata block** - A block containing one or more metadata tags and/or a source path/owner line. A block ends with a blank line or _a single source path/owner line_. This means that one more monikers followed by multiple source path/owner lines will only apply the metadata to the first source path/owner line. Each and every one source path/owner line requires its own metadata monikers.
- **Source path/owner line** - A single source path/owner line in CODEOWNERS is its own block. There are some metadata tags that must be part of a block that ends in source path/owner line and some tags that can be. These are defined below.

## Metadata Monikers

- **AzureSdkOwners:** - This moniker is used to denote Azure Sdk owners that have triage responsibility for a given service label. This moniker must be part of a block containing a ServiceLabel entry.
- **PRLabel:** - This moniker is used by workflows to determine what label(s) will get added to a pull request based upon the file paths of the files in the pull request. This moniker must be part of a block that ends in a source path/owner line.
- **ServiceLabel:** - This moniker contains the service label that's used to figure out what users need to be @ mentioned in an issue when the Service Attention label is added. This moniker must be part of a block that either ends in a source path/owner line, the ServiceOwners moniker or the /&lt;NotInRepo&gt;/ moniker. If the ServiceLabel is part of a block that ends in the source path/owner line, the service owners are inferred from that.
- **ServiceOwners:** - The moniker is used to identify the owners associated with a service label if the service label isn't part of a block ending in a source path/owner line. This moniker cannot be part of a source path/owner line.
- **/&lt;NotInRepo&gt;/** - This is the existing moniker used to denote service owners in CODEOWNERS files. This will ultimately be replaced by the ServiceOwners moniker, which more clearly defines what it actually is, but right now the parser and linter will handle both. This moniker cannot be part of a source path/owner line. Also, this is the only moniker that doesn't have a colon separator after the moniker, before the labels.

## Examples of moniker usage in CODEOWNERS files

This list of examples is exhaustive. If an example isn't in here then it won't work and the linter will catch it.

- A single source path/owner line is its own block.

```text

# Optional comment
/sdk/SomePath/  @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2 @Azure/fakeTeam1

```

- `AzureSdkOwners` must be part of a block that contains a ServiceLabel entry. If that block ends in a source path/owner line, and the AzureSdkOwners entry is empty, it'll have the same owners that are only the source path/owner line. If it's part of block that contains a ServiceLabel/ServiceOwner combination, then it must have it's own owners defined.

```text

# AzureSdkOwners: @fakeUser3 @fakeUser4
# ServiceLabel: %fakeLabel12
/sdk/SomePath/  @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2 @Azure/fakeTeam1
OR
# AzureSdkOwners:
# ServiceLabel: %fakeLabel12
/sdk/SomePath/  @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2 @Azure/fakeTeam1
OR
# AzureSdkOwners: @fakeUser3 @fakeUser4
# ServiceLabel: %fakeLabel12
# ServiceOwners: @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2

```

- `PRLabel` must be part of a block that ends in a source path/owner

```text

# PRLabel: %Label1 %Label2
/sdk/SomePath/  @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2 @Azure/fakeTeam1

```

- If a `ServiceLabel` is part of a block that ends in a source path/owner line, the ServiceOwners will be the inferred to be the same as the source owners. A ServiceLabel ending in a source path/owners block cannot have a ServiceOwners entry because the entire reason it's part of that block is because the service owners and source owners are the same. _This is only time that a moniker not explicitly in the block will have inferred data._

```text

# ServiceLabel: %Label1 %Label2
/sdk/SomePath/  @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2 @Azure/fakeTeam1

```

- If a `ServiceLabel` is not part of a block that ends in a source path/owner line, then it must be part of a two line block consisting only of a ServiceLabel and either a ServiceOwners or /&lt;NotInRepo&gt;/. New entries should use ServiceOwners.

```text

# ServiceLabel: %Label1 %Label2
# ServiceOwners: @fakeUser1 @Azure/fakeTeam1
OR
# ServiceLabel: %Label1 %Label2
# /&lt;NotInRepo&gt;/ @fakeUser1 @Azure/fakeTeam1

```

- This might look complex but there are really only 2 types of blocks. The first ends with a source path/owner line and may have AzureSdkOwners, ServiceLabel and PRLabel entries. The second is ServiceLabel/ServiceOwner block which may have AzureSdkOwners.

```text

# AzureSdkOwners: (optional)
# ServiceLabel: (optional)
# PRLabel: (optional)
/sdk/SomePath/  @fakeUser1 @fakeUser2 @Azure/fakeTeam1

```

```text

# AzureSdkOwners: (optional)
# ServiceLabel: %Label1 %Label2
# ServiceOwners: @fakeUser1 @Azure/fakeTeam1

```
