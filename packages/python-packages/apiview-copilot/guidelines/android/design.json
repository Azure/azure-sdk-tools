If your service is not HTTP-based, please contact the [Azure SDK Architecture Board][Architecture Board] for guidance.\n\nAzure services are exposed to Android developers as one or more service client types and a set of supporting types.\n\nService clients are the main starting points for developers calling Azure services with the Azure SDK. Each client library should have at least one client in its main namespace, so it\u2019s easy to discover. The guidelines in this section describe patterns for the design of a service client. Because for Android both synchronous and asynchronous service clients are required, the sections below are organized into general service client guidance, followed by sync- and async-specific guidance."

The primary usage provides headers that match the ETag to some known value.  The ETag is an opaque identifier that represents a single version of a resource. For example, adding the following header will translate to \"if the record's version, specified by the ETag, is not the same\".\n\n{% highlight text %}\nIf-Not-Match: \"etag-value\"\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nWith headers, tests are possible for the following:\nUnconditionally (no additional headers)\nIf (not) modified since a version (If-Match and If-Not-Match)\nIf (not) modified since a date (If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since)\nIf (not) present (If-Match and If-Not-Match with a ETag=* value)\n\nNot all services support all of these semantics, and may not support any of them.  Developers have varying levels of understanding of the ETag and conditional requests, so it is best to abstract this concept from the API surface.  There are two types of conditional requests we need to be concerned with:\n\nSafe conditional requests (e.g. GET)\n\nThese are typically used to save bandwidth in an \"update cache\" scenario, i.e. I have a cached value, only send me the data if what the service has is newer than my copy. These return either a 200 or a 304 status code, indicating the value was not modified, which tells the caller that their cached value is up to date.\n\nUnsafe conditional requests (e.g. POST, PUT, or DELETE)\n\nThese are typically used to prevent losing updates in an optimistic concurrency scenario, i.e. I've modified the cached value I'm holding, but don't update the service version unless it has the same copy I've got. These return either a success or a 412 error status code, indicating the value was modified, to indicate to the caller that they'll need to retry their update if they want it to succeed.\n\nThese two cases are handled differently in client libraries.  However, the form of the call is the same in both cases.  The signature of the method should be:\n\n{% highlight text %}\nclient.(, requestOptions)\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nThe requestOptions field provides preconditions to the HTTP request.  The Etag value will be retrieved from the item that is passed into the method where possible, and method arguments where not possible. The form of the method will be modified based on idiomatic usage patterns in the language of choice.  In cases where the ETag value is not known, the operation cannot be conditional.\nIf the library developer does not need to support advanced usage of precondition headers, they can add a boolean parameter that is set to true to establish the condition.  For example, use one of the following boolean names instead of the conditions operator:\nonlyIfChanged\nonlyIfUnchanged\nonlyIfMissing\nonlyIfPresent\n\nIn all cases, the conditional expression is \"opt-in\", and the default is to perform the operation unconditionally.\n\nThe return value from a conditional operation must be carefully considered.  For safe operators (e.g. GET), return a response that will throw if the value is accessed (or follow the same convention used fro a 204 No Content response), since there is no value in the body to reference.  For unsafe operators (e.g. PUT, DELETE, or POST), throw a specific error when a Precondition Failed or Conflict result is received.  This allows the consumer to do something different in the case of conflicting results.\n\nYOU SHOULD accept a conditions parameter (which takes an enumerated type) on service methods that allow a conditional check on the service.\n\nYOU SHOULD accept an additional boolean or enum parameter on service methods as necessary to enable conditional checks using ETag.\n\nYOU SHOULD include the ETag field as part of the object model when conditional operations are supported.\n\n<p><a href=\"#{{ include.id }}\" name=\"{{ include.id }}\" class='requirement' role='img' aria-label='YOU SHOULD NOT'>\u26a0\ufe0f</a> <strong>YOU SHOULD NOT</strong></p>\n\n\nYOU SHOULD throw a distinct error when a 412 Precondition Failed response or a 409 Conflict response is received from the service due to a conditional check.\n\nTODO: Add discussion of hierarchical clients\n\nModel types are classes that developers of applications use to provide required information into, or to receive information from, Azure services.
