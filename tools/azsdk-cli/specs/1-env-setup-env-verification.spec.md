## Definitions

**Environment Setup**: The process of ensuring all required tools and dependencies are installed and properly configured for SDK development work.

**Requirements**: Language-specific and core tools needed to successfully run Azure SDK MCP tools (e.g., TypeSpec compiler, language SDKs, build tools).

**Verification Check**: A command or script that determines whether a specific requirement is installed and accessible in the environment.

**Lazy Loading**: Checking only the requirements for the repository currently being worked on, rather than checking all requirements upfront.

**Source of Truth**: A single, authoritative configuration that defines what requirements are needed for each tool and how to install them.

---

## Background / Problem Statement

### Current State

**Current state per language:**

- **.NET**: Developers manually discover missing dependencies when build or generation commands fail. No proactive verification.
- **Java**: Same as .NET - reactive discovery through failures.
- **JavaScript**: Same as .NET - reactive discovery through failures.
- **Python**: `azure-sdk-for-python` has `azpysdk` which can be used for some validation checks, but no proactive verification.
- **Go**: Same as .NET - reactive discovery through failures.

### Why This Matters

Without proactive environment verification:

1. **Poor Developer Experience**: Developers waste time debugging cryptic error messages that are actually due to missing tools
2. **Friction for New Contributors**: New team members or open-source contributors struggle to get started
3. **MCP Agent Limitations**: When the agent attempts to run tools and they fail due to missing dependencies, the agent can't distinguish between actual errors and setup issues
4. **Context Switching Pain**: When developers work across multiple language repos, they must manually remember and install different requirements for each language

**Agent vs. Manual Workflow:**

- **With Agent (Current)**: Agent attempts a command ‚Üí fails ‚Üí developer must interpret error ‚Üí manually install missing tool ‚Üí retry
- **With Agent (Proposed)**: Agent checks setup first ‚Üí proactively tells developer what's missing and how to fix it ‚Üí developer installs ‚Üí proceed with confidence
- **Manual CLI (Current)**: Developer runs command ‚Üí fails ‚Üí searches documentation or asks teammates ‚Üí installs tool ‚Üí retry
- **Manual CLI (Proposed)**: Developer explicitly runs `azsdk verify-setup` ‚Üí sees clear list of missing items ‚Üí follows install instructions ‚Üí proceeds

This tool bridges the gap and makes the agent workflow much more reliable.

## Goals and Exceptions/Limitations

### Goals

What are we trying to achieve with this design?

- [ ] Proactively verify that required dependencies are installed before running MCP operations
- [ ] Provide clear, actionable installation instructions when requirements are missing
- [ ] Support language-specific requirement checking (lazy loading based on current context)
- [ ] Work seamlessly in both MCP (agent) and CLI execution modes
- [ ] Minimize developer friction when working across multiple language repositories
- [ ] Establish a foundation for dynamic requirement discovery in future versions

### Exceptions and Limitations

_Known cases where this approach doesn't work or has limitations._

#### Exception 1: Hard-Coded Requirements (Scenario 1 Limitation)

**Description:**

In V1, requirements and installation instructions are hard-coded in the tool rather than derived from a dynamic source of truth (e.g., devcontainer configs, CI definitions).

**Impact:**

- Maintenance burden: When tools or versions change, the code must be updated
- Potential drift: Hard-coded requirements may become outdated if not regularly maintained
- No single source of truth across repos

**Workaround:**

For V1, this is acceptable to prove the concept. V2 will address dynamic requirement discovery (see Open Questions).

---

#### Exception 2: Installation Instruction Specificity

**Description:**

Some installation steps may be complex or environment-specific (e.g., Windows vs. Linux, different shell configurations, corporate proxy settings).

**Impact:**

Generic instructions may not work for all developer environments, requiring developers to adapt instructions to their context.

**Workaround:**

- Provide instructions that work for the most common scenarios
- Rely on Copilot agent to help interpret and adapt instructions when needed
- Link to comprehensive documentation for complex cases

---

#### Exception 3: Cross-Language Requirement Conflicts

**Description:**

If a developer requests verification for multiple languages (e.g., `--langs python,java`) and one language's requirements fail, it's unclear whether to:

- Block the entire operation
- Continue checking remaining languages and report all failures

**Impact:**

Developer experience depends on this decision - blocking is safer but less informative, while continuing provides more information but may be confusing.

**Workaround:**

**Proposed behavior**: Continue checking all requested languages and report all missing requirements together. This gives developers a complete picture of what needs to be fixed.

---

#### Language-Specific Limitations

| Language   | Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|------------|------------|--------|------------|
| .NET       | Multiple .NET SDK versions may be installed; need to verify correct version | May pass check but still fail with version mismatch | Check for specific version in verification command |
| Java       | Multiple JDK installations; Maven vs. Gradle detection | Similar version/tooling mismatch | Check `JAVA_HOME` and verify Maven availability |
| JavaScript | Multiple Node versions via nvm; npm vs. yarn | Version mismatch possible | Check Node version explicitly |
| Python     | Virtual environment must be activated; multiple Python versions | Tool may not be accessible if venv not activated | Instructions explicitly mention venv activation |
| Go         | Multiple Go versions via version managers | Version mismatch possible | Check Go version explicitly |

---

## Design Proposal

### Overview

The `verify-setup` tool checks whether required dependencies for SDK development are installed in the environment. It operates in two modes:

1. **Implicit**: Agent will suggest to run this tool before other tools, checking requirements for the detected language of the repo
2. **Explicit**: Developer or agent explicitly invokes the tool

The tool uses a hard-coded registry of requirements (V1) that includes:

- What to check for each requirement
- How to verify it's installed
- Instructions for installing if missing

### Detailed Design

#### Requirements Registry Structure

The requirements are organized into categories based on language, in addition to a "core" section for non-language specific requirements:

```json
{
    "categories": {
        "core": [...],
        "java": [...],
        "javascript": [...],
        "dotnet": [...],
        "go": [...],
        "python": [
            {
                "requirement": "python",
                "check": ["python", "--version"],
                "instructions": []
            },
            {
                "requirement": "azpysdk",
                "check": ["azpysdk", "--help"],
                "instructions": ["Ensure your virtual environment is activated", "python -m pip install eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools[build]", "Check that it was installed with `azpysdk --help`"]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### CLI Command

**Command**: `azsdk verify-setup`

**Parameters**:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--langs` | string[] | No | Current repo language | Comma-separated list of languages to verify (e.g., `python,java`) |
| `--all` | flag | No | false | Check requirements for all languages |

**Examples**:

```bash
# Check requirements for current repo's language (detected automatically)
azsdk verify-setup

# Check Python requirements explicitly
azsdk verify-setup --langs python

# Check multiple languages
azsdk verify-setup --langs python,java

# Check all languages
azsdk verify-setup --all
```

#### MCP Tool Invocation

**Tool Name**: `verify-setup`

**MCP Parameters**:

```json
{
  "languages": ["python", "java"],
}
```

**When Invoked**:

- **Before Tool Calls**: When user requests a tool, verify requirements first
- **On user request**: When user asks the agent to check their setup, environment, installations, etc.

### User Experience

#### Success Case (All Requirements Met)

```bash
$ azsdk verify-setup --langs python

‚úÖ Verifying Python environment setup...

All requirements are installed:
  ‚úÖ Python 3.8+
  ‚úÖ azpysdk

Your environment is ready for Python SDK development!
```

#### Failure Case (Missing Requirements)

```bash
$ azsdk verify-setup --langs python,java

‚ö†Ô∏è  Verifying Python and Java environment setup...

Python Requirements:
  ‚úÖ Python 3.8+
  ‚ùå azpysdk - MISSING

Java Requirements:
  ‚úÖ Java JDK 11+
  ‚ùå Maven - MISSING

---

To fix missing requirements:
üì¶ azpysdk:
   1. Navigate to your azure-sdk-for-python repo
   2. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
   3. Run: python -m pip install -e eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools[build]
   4. Verify installation with: azpysdk --help

üì¶ Maven:
  1. Download the latest version of Maven.
  2. Set MAVEN_HOME environment variable to the Maven installation path
  3. Add MAVEN_HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable
  4. Restart your IDE

After installing, run 'azsdk verify-setup --langs python,java' again to verify.
```

#### MCP Agent Interaction

**User**: "Check my environment setup"

**Agent**: _Runs verify-setup for current repo language_

```text
I've checked your Python environment setup. You're missing one requirement:

‚ùå azpysdk

To install it:
1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated
2. Run: python -m pip install -e eng/tools/azure-sdk-tools[build]
3. Verify with: azpysdk --help

```

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Dynamic Requirements from Devcontainer Config

**Description:**

Instead of hard-coding requirements, parse them from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` files in each language repo.

**Pros:**

- Single source of truth (devcontainer config)
- Automatically stays in sync with container definitions
- Leverages existing infrastructure

**Cons:**

- Devcontainer configs may not be complete or consistent across repos
- Requires parsing different formats (some repos use Docker images, others use features)
- Installation instructions not typically included in devcontainer configs
- Adds complexity for a V1 tool

**Why not chosen:**

For V1, we want to prove the concept with minimal dependencies. V2 can explore dynamic discovery once we understand the usage patterns.

---

### Alternative 2: Check Requirements Only When Other Tools Fail

**Description:**

Don't provide a standalone verify-setup tool. Instead, when other tools fail (e.g., generate-sdk), detect if it's an environment issue and suggest specific fixes.

**Pros:**

- No separate tool needed
- More contextual (only checks what's needed for the failing operation)
- Simpler for developers (fewer commands to learn)

**Cons:**

- Reactive instead of proactive
- Developers can't proactively check their setup before starting work
- Each tool would need to implement error detection logic
- Harder to onboard new contributors who want to verify setup upfront

**Why not chosen:**

A proactive verification tool provides better developer experience, especially for onboarding and when working across multiple languages.

---

### Alternative 3: Integration with Devcontainers CLI

**Description:**

Use the devcontainers CLI tool to build and validate container images locally, ensuring the environment matches CI.

**Pros:**

- Guarantees environment matches CI/CD
- Comprehensive solution

**Cons:**

- Requires Docker and devcontainers CLI installed
- Much heavier solution (downloading/building containers)
- Not all developers want to work in containers
- Slower feedback loop

**Why not chosen:**

Too heavy for a V1 environment verification tool. This could be a future option for developers who want container-based development.

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] **Question 1**: How should we handle dynamic requirement discovery in V2?
  - Context: Hard-coding requirements in V1 works but isn't maintainable long-term
  - Options:
    - Parse `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` files from each repo
    - Use CI pipeline definitions (e.g., `ci.yml`) as source of truth
    - Create a new eng/common config file specifically for dev requirements
    - Leverage devcontainers CLI to interrogate container definitions
  - **Proposal**: Explore eng/common config file that each repo can customize, with a standard schema

- [ ] **Question 2**: Should installation instructions be in per-language copilot-instructions.md instead?
  - Context: copilot-instructions already has instructions for installing Powershell if it's missing

- [ ] **Question 3**: Should each tool be responsible for checking their own requirements instead of having a central tool?
  - **Proposal**: Start with the one VerifySetup tool for V1. If it doesn't perform well, we can explore this more.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Verification (V1)

- **Milestone**: Basic environment verification with hard-coded requirements
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Tasks**:
  - Define requirements registry structure
  - Implement language detection logic (reuse existing LanguageResolver)
  - Implement requirement checking logic (run commands, capture results)
  - Format output with installation instructions
  - Add MCP tool wrapper
  - Add CLI command

### Phase 2: MCP Integration

- **Milestone**: Auto-run on MCP server start
- **Timeline**: 1-3 days
- **Tasks**:
  - Hook verify-setup into MCP server startup
  - Add telemetry for verification results
  - Test with agent in different language repos

### Phase 3: Enhanced Output & Docs

- **Milestone**: Improved UX and documentation
- **Timeline**: 1 week
- **Tasks**:
  - Improve output formatting (colors, icons, clear sections)
  - Add documentation to README
  - Create examples and troubleshooting guide
  - Add copilot-instructions examples for agent usage

### Phase 4 (Future): Dynamic Discovery

- **Milestone**: Requirements derived from source of truth config
- **Timeline**: TBD (V2)
- **Dependencies**: Decisions on Open Questions 1 and 4

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test requirement checking logic with mock commands
- Test parameter parsing (--langs, --all)

### Integration Tests

- Test actual requirement checking with real commands
- Test in environments with missing dependencies
- Test across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Test with virtual environments (Python) and version managers (nvm, gvm)

### Manual Testing

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Clean Environment**: Run in fresh environment with no tools installed
   - Expected: All requirements reported as missing with instructions

2. **Partial Installation**: Install some but not all requirements
   - Expected: Correctly identify which are installed vs. missing

3. **Multi-Language**: Run with `--langs python,java`
   - Expected: Check requirements for both languages, report combined results, and ensure no other languages were evaluated

4. **Current Repo Detection**: Run without parameters in different language repos
   - Expected: Automatically detect and check correct language

5. **MCP Server Startup**: Start MCP server in each language repo
   - Expected: Auto-verify requirements and inform user of any issues

6. **Agent Interaction**: Ask agent "check my environment setup"
   - Expected: Agent invokes tool and presents results naturally

### Cross-Language Validation

Test in each language repository:

- [ ] azure-sdk-for-python
- [ ] azure-sdk-for-java
- [ ] azure-sdk-for-js
- [ ] azure-sdk-for-net
- [ ] azure-sdk-for-go
- [ ] azure-rest-api-specs

Verify:

- Language detection works correctly
- Requirements are appropriate for each language
- Installation instructions are accurate and complete

## Future Work

- Determine how to dynamically get requirements, instead of relying on a hard-coded config
- Explore invoking verifySetup when another tool fails due to missing dependencies

## Meeting Notes

### 10/9 Discussion - Key Takeaways

1. **Source of Truth**: Agreement that there should be one source-of-truth config (from eng/common or each repo) for all requirements
   - Consider devcontainers as potential source
   - May need devcontainers CLI tool to build container images

2. **Installation Instructions**: Concern over hard-coding detailed installation instructions
   - Should first check if Copilot can handle it automatically
   - Richard suggested lang-specific copilot-instructions.md (similar to PowerShell installation approach)

3. **Lazy Loading**: Agreement on "lazy loading" approach
   - Only check requirements for current repository being developed
   - Don't block the developer with requirements for languages they're not using
   - Example: Dev in Python repo starts MCP ‚Üí check only core and Python requirements

4. **Tool vs. Feature Question**: Discussion whether this needs to be standalone tool
   - Alternative: When other MCP tools fail, they return specific installation instructions
   - Decided: Standalone tool is valuable for proactive checking and onboarding

### Action Items from Meeting

- [ ] Prototype with lazy loading based on current repo
- [ ] Test how well Copilot handles specificity of installation instructions
- [ ] Evaluate if instructions should go in copilot-instructions.md or stay in tool
